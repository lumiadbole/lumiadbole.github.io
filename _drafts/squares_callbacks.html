title: my personal squares callbacks
---

so due to my identities, i have come up with several callbacks for various
squares calls that are pretty different from the popular ones i hear
<br { line-height: 150%; } />

organized roughly by level: <br { line-height: 150%; } />

column circulate: i say "duck duck" because it's the start of coordinate <br />
couples circulate: i say "like a couple". this evolved from someone saying "like
couples" as a callback, and i changed it to this because "like a couple up" is a
c3a concept. <br />
eight chain (x): instead of counting with numbers, i count down spirit island
elements, starting from sun <br />
spin chain thru: this ends in "chain thru", so i say the name of the call like i
would for square chain thru <br />
coordinate: inspired by someone i know from minnesota, i say "gray duck" instead
of "goose" follow your neighbor: i have a 1/3 chance of saying "hello (name of
person who is actually my neighbor)" <br />
mix: i have a 2/3 chance of saying "nyeow" instead of "meow", this is because i
misheard the callback a long time ago to be the airplane sound instead of the
cat sound <br />
triple star thru: instead of "hand waist nose", i say 3 of starlight's growth
options <br />
