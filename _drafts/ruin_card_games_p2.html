title: "how to ruin card games, part 2: cheating"
---

<p>one good way to ruin a card game is by cheating.</p>

<p>
  cheating can be sorted into two categories: discreet and blatant. these two
  types work differently and do different things.
</p>

<h2>1a: discreet cheating</h2>
<p>
  discreet cheating is cheating where you try to not be noticed. it can have
  several goals:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    giving you an advantage in the game. this makes other players win less and
    maybe enjoy the game less. one example of this is surreptitiously grabbing
    free coins or victory points, or stacking the deck.
  </li>
  <li>
    giving someone else a disadvantage in the game. i'll cover this in more
    detail in a later part, but one example is peeking at someone's card before
    you tell them that they're bleeding.
  </li>
</ul>
