in the spirit of today, i wrote a cipher liar tentaisho <br />
(i promise that i will write vanilla logic puzzles too, the first two are just
silly)<br { line-height: 150%; } />

cipher: all symbols stand for a clue where different symbols stand for different
clues and the same symbol stands for the same clue <br />
liar: one clue in each row and each column is incorrect
<br { line-height: 150%; } />

if you want to solve using penpa, the link is

you to color up
