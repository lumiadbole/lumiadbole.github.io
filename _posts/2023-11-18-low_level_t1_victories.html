<p>
  so d tier on my tier list from
  <a href="/si_theory/2023/11/12/more_t1_victories.html">the last post</a> are
  the spirits that can win on turn 1, but not against a level 6 adversary.
  here's how those work:
</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">sparking</button>
<div class="content">
  <ul>
    <li>start on board d, initial explore jungles</li>
    <li>g3, bottom track to d1, play all your slow powers</li>
    <li>sparking innate yourself, gain and play haunts and embers</li>
    <li>haunts and embers d5, generating 4 fear, cascade into d4</li>
    <li>shatter d7, generating 2 more fear (total 6)</li>
    <li>smite d2, destroy the explorer and add a badlands</li>
    <li>
      harbingers push 2 dahan from d1 to d2, generating 1 more fear (total 7)
    </li>
    <li>
      dahan reclaim fishing grounds wipes d2, generating 2 more fear (total 9)
    </li>
    <li>isolation removes d6 explorer</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">both wildfires</button>
<div class="content">
  <ul>
    <li>start on thematic board se, initial explore sands</li>
    <li>
      g2, either track to se6, 1 damage, push the dahan to se1, gain haunts and
      embers
    </li>
    <li>play haunts and embers</li>
    <li>haunts and embers se8, generate 4 fear, cascade to se7 se8 se6</li>
    <li>flip aid from lesser spirits, take spur on</li>
    <li>spur on plays threatening flames</li>
    <li>
      threatening flames push a town from se6 to se1, generating 2 fear (6
      total). if trans, push the damaged town, if cis, push the undamaged town.
    </li>
    <li>
      if trans, right innate forgets both 2-costs to gain 2 power cards and 2
      fire
    </li>
    <li>
      firestorm destroys the explorer in se7 and destroys the se6 town,
      generating 1 fear (7 total). if trans, push the 2 explorers from se6 to
      se1
    </li>
    <li>
      dahan reclaim fishing grounds deals 3 damage in se1. if trans, destroy the
      2 explorers and the damaged town, if cis, destroy 1 town and deal 1 damage
      to the other one. this generates 1 fear (8 total)
    </li>
    <li>isolation removes the other town from se1</li>
  </ul>
</div>
