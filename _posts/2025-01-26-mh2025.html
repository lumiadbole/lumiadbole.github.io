<h2>the day before</h2>

<p>
  i arrived on campus at 10:30am, and i went to the banana lounge to play
  nomifactory (ceu 1.7a) until someone else arrived.
</p>
<p>
  soon, adal and zimodo came over. i decided to download gtnh and we looked
  through its questbook in a creative world just in case there was a puzzle
  about it. most of it (up until uhv ish) was stuff i was decently familiar
  with, but we did find a few silly things such as the "you're gonna hate this"
  quest series.
</p>
<p>
  while this was happening, adal was building a periodic table out of a bag of
  big and small bananagrams tiles that just happened to be on the table we were
  sitting at. we first tried making the big tiles the uppercase letters and the
  small tiles the lowercase letters, but that was only enough for about a
  quarter of the table, so we instead decided to just focus on the uppercase
  letters. however, we still had not enough of the letters that we wanted, so we
  started doing shenanigans such as using u's turned sideways for extra c's.
</p>

<p>
  afterwards, we went to le meridien in an attempt to meet more people. the only
  people we met there were a few people from cardinality whose names i have
  mostly forgotten already. since adal was wearing his birdsuit (which was red),
  and since cardinality was eventually the first team to finish, this
  interaction was to be the first of many times people thought he was affiliated
  with cardinality.
</p>
<p>
  we (i, adal, and cardinality people) then proceeded to teach zimodo the rules
  of finding friends (aka tractor, aka ÂçáÁ∫ß) and spent a couple hours playing.
  while playing, i mentioned silly things such as placing a wild draw 4 and
  vigor of the breaking dawn in the kitty, and i was pleasantly surprised that
  most of the people at that table actually understood what i was talking about.
  (i am hopeful that this might mean that a spirit island puzzle might actually
  exist in mh 2026 (my hope is to get spirit island as a category on
  <a href="https://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/">devjoe's index</a>))
</p>
<p>
  afterwards, we went back to campus and did nothing until the how to hunt
  workshop, since people weren't doing anything on campus. there weren't that
  many people at the how to hunt workshop in person, but john from ttbnl who was
  the main speaker was being quite funny so it was worth going. after it ended,
  i went to visit some people on teammate hanging out in what was going to be
  our designated classroom for hunt. i could only stay for a few minutes, but i
  did get to clarify a few rules interactions happening in a game of innovation.
  (speaking of innovation, i still want to acquire innovation ultimate)
</p>

<h2>friday</h2>
<p>
  i went to flour for the now traditional puzzlers club meetup. (note: puzzlers
  club is distinct from mit puzzle club) the size of the meetup has grown from
  17 in 2023 to 33 last year to 36 this year.
</p>
<p>
  then i went to a different flour for the traditional teammate meetup. we were
  planning to walk to the kickoff room in building 10 (kickoff was in 3 distinct
  locations this year since kresge was under maintenance). when we entered the
  room, a bunch of people decided to take pictures of 6 pieces of paper that
  were taped to the wall, thinking that they were a puzzle. it turned out that
  they weren't, and i didn't worry about them at all since i saw them at the how
  to hunt workshop on thursday.
</p>
<p>
  kickoff was pretty good, they projected a video instead of performing a live
  skit because kickoff was in 3 different rooms. i really liked the
  neurodivergent person (ferdinand) and the lesbians (katrina and baby). the
  plot also transitioned into the hunt very well.
</p>
<p>
  afterwards, we went to our rooms. i decided to go check out the gala, and i
  saw that d&m wasn't letting anyone in until the hunt actually started. this
  was also partially to find a short path between the gala and our room, and i
  found out that using the bridges on the third floor was the best choice.
</p>
<p>
  the unlock structure worked a lot differently this year than previous years.
  in previous years, we were just given puzzles that unlocked in a strict order.
  now, we had a set number of keys to unlock puzzles with, and a few more
  puzzles that we could see a description of but couldn't look at directly until
  we unlocked them. i liked this design since it meant that we can selectively
  unlock puzzles that we knew we would work on, and have a larger number of
  puzzles that we could know about without getting overwhelmed. the main issue
  would probably have been coordinating these unlocks between teams, but
  teammate just chose 3 people to give the exclusive authority to unlock
  puzzles. i think this worked mainly since everyone trusted them to make the
  correct decisions, which may not be the case for other teams.
</p>
<p>
  i decided to sit near justin yokota, to whom i mentioned that we'd probably be
  working on the same puzzles a lot of the time. early on, he had the idea of
  giving ferdinand a croissant at the gala and seeing what they had to say about
  it. we didn't know it was actually puzzle content, so the response we did get
  when we did it was kinda disappointing.
</p>

<h3>puzzles i did on friday</h3>
<p>(you can click these to open spoilers btw)</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">unreal islands</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    i jumped on this quickly when i saw that it was a nurikabe. when i solve
    logic puzzles, i usually use "pencil and paper" (read: snipping tool)
    instead of spreadsheets, which had the side effect of not being able to
    share my work with others. however, i was making progress substantially
    faster than everyone else was, so we decided to rearrange our seats so that
    they could see my screen and point out any deductions that i could make, as
    well as start working on extraction. this worked well and made unreal
    islands our second solve of the hunt.
  </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">üìëüçù</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    so while i was looking at the unlocked puzzles for one i felt like i could
    make meaningful progress on, a teammate asked me if i knew people on other
    teams, and if so, to send them this copypasta. because of my ties to
    puzzlers club and mit puzzle club, i knew a lot of people on a lot of teams.
    so i sent to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>left out (through walker)</li>
    <li>et phone in answer</li>
    <li>literally animal farm (through adal)</li>
    <li>math and vehem (through zimodo)</li>
    <li>so true beastie</li>
    <li>random hall</li>
    <li>
      i could also have sent to many more teams like 17th shard and providence
      but other teammates reached them first.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>this was definitely my favorite puzzle this year for humor value.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">do the manual calculations</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    i looked a bit at this puzzle, figured out how it worked, and then didn't
    know how to do the math required. several teammates did go :notlikeduck:
    after seeing this puzzle, which is probably the reaction that the author(s)
    wanted.
  </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">this is just a test</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>wow, a lot of logic puzzles</p>
  <p>
    i broke the nonogram halfway through, did the fillomino using arithmetic,
    then did the yajilin without much difficulty, then the hungarian tapa
    without placing most of the numbers, and finally did the skyscrapers.
  </p>
  <p>
    afterwards, i did the fillomino using arithmetic, then did the yajilin
    without much difficulty, then the hungarian tapa and placed the rest of the
    numbers, and finally broke the skyscrapers halfway through.
  </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">lab scrabble</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    this puzzle hit two of my past hyperfixations perfectly. i think i had an
    easier time calculating the scores than my teammates since i have basically
    theta(1) speed mapping from elements to atomic numbers, without needing any
    outside references.
  </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">the center is in plain sight</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    i did about half of this puzzle, namely the elements, stereogram, and
    constellation parts. i did in fact recognize bootes in the constellation
    part from memory.

    i wanted to solve this puzzle but it was solved while i was asleep :dismay:

<h2>puzzles i did on saturday</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">absolutely not balderdash</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    i worked on it a bit, stopped working on it to look at other puzzles, and
    then someone pointed out that this uses the set of scrabble tiles so i
    jumped back onto this and eventually helped finish it
  </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">kindred spirits</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    i opened this puzzle, did some of the crossword clues, and then left when i
    could not make more progress on them and realized that this was about the
    alcoholic spirits and not spirit island
  </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">deepfrost</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    on saturday, i saw the description, looked at the sheet that we had, and
    went to go look at other puzzles. after solving absolutely not balderdash, i
    came back to this puzzle and realized that i could download the world that
    this map was in.
  </p>
  <p>
    so i downloaded the entire contents of the hermitcraft world that this was
    from, which was 2gb, then unzipped it and put it into my saves folder. i
    then spent some time with two teammates trying to figure out where the
    starting point was, and where you ended up after going east (since going
    east then northeast led back to the start)
  </p>
  <p>
    after figuring out those details, we started looking for stuff in the map.
    we eventually got to the point where we needed to find the intersection of
    the two line segments. i tried to use desmos, but one of the teammates i was
    working with was using geogebra and was faster, so we decided to just make
    him find all the line intersections from now on. (there were a lot to come)
  </p>
  <p>
    while we were working through the text adventure, i was also flying around
    in spectator mode in the actual world, looking for where the places we stood
    actually were in the world. this was how i found the way to get to the key
    on floor 2 and the entrance on floor 3.
  </p>
  <p>
    once we got to floor 4, we found that the eggs we passed by were actually
    important, and we didn't really want to go around looking for them.
    fortunately, their locations in the text adventure corresponded to their
    locations in the actual world, so i looked for them in the actual world,
    with assistance from the hermitcraft wiki (unfortunately on f*ndom). also
    fortunately, we wrote down the artifacts that we found on each floor so we
    didn't have to look for them again to figure out which egg they were
    connected to.
  </p>
  <p>
    by this point, i was getting motion sickness from flying around in
    spectator, so i had to take a break from looking for eggs. i think i just
    get motion sick a lot more easily in spectator mode than in other gamemodes.
  </p>
  <p>
    at the end, we found the instructions on floor 3, so i decided to just move
    my character in the text adventure to floor 4 and wait for my teammates to
    find the other artifacts that we needed. we found both artifacts on floor 1,
    so i spent a while moving my character to x -646 in the text adventure
    (which took a pretty complicated path for some reason) and waited for my
    teammates to find the second artifact on floor 3.
  </p>
  <p>
    anyways, that was my favorite puzzle that hunt on purely content terms. i
    asked frictionlessemu if he wrote this puzzle and he told me he didn't get
    to write any puzzles in this hunt, which also meant no gregtech puzzle.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">todo: tile that rectangle</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    i printed this out using mit's printers, and together with a few teammates,
    cut the individual pieces out and began assembling. i enjoyed finding words
    that fit all of the constraints, especially wicked. there wasn't much
    interesting to say about this puzzle, but i did get tripped up at "leg ends"
  </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">bar talk</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    i came in at the last extraction step and helped plot stuff on the vowel
    chart. it turns out that i really like parts of puzzles that use charts that
    i have memorized (this one being the ipa vowel chart)
  </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">_land</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    i figured out how this puzzle worked pretty quickly, and i noticed the
    nautical flags pretty quickly. however, this puzzle got cheesed using the
    source code, and i think i would have had more fun solving it without using
    the source code
  </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">bermuda triangle</button>

    i wanted to solve this puzzle but it was solved while i was asleep :dismay:
  </p>
</div>

<h2>sunday</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">alias</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    when i saw the answer to alias i was hoping that said something about
    ferdinand being trans, but it turns out that shirley was not a particularly
    gendered name.
  </p>
  <p>also, w i d e f e r d i n a n d</p>
</div>
<p>
  this was around the time cardinality finished, so some people from cardinality
  that knew us well came over to spectate us. we jokingly asked them for
  answers, and i think they just gave us encouragement.
</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">shell corporations</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    we solved the shell corporations in this order (underlined numbers are the
    ones we solved, arrows are what puzzle we used to backsolve):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><u>1</u></li>
    <li><u>3</u></li>
    <li><u>7</u> <- 1</li>
    <li><u>4</u> <- 7</li>
    <li><u>6</u></li>
    <li><u>8</u></li>
    <li><u>2</u> <- 8</li>
    <li><u>5</u></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    1 was solved on saturday night, missing two of the feeders. 3 was solved
    slightly later on saturday night but i didn't really look at it.
  </p>
  <p>
    on sunday afternoon, we found that penrose was a good feeder for 1. it
    didn't work for any of the feeders, but we tried it on some of the other
    shell corporations and 7 worked.
  </p>
  <p>
    7 wasn't too hard to figure out the mechanics of, so we backsolved that to
    get that it used 1's answer plus acrylate, which was the correct answer to
    4.
  </p>
  <p>
    afterwards, i spent a while looking at 8. initially we ran into a lot of
    contradictions since we did not have any strings containing a state whose
    animal was either a moose or a deer that was also compatible with the
    numbers. we had to wait for more feeders to get solved.
  </p>
  <p>
    then, 6 was solved. the answer it gave fit into our grid perfectly, and the
    remaining squares that didn't have letters had a unique path through them. i
    was able to gradually wheel of fortune through the letters of those squares,
    and picked up the answer to 2.
  </p>
  <p>finally, 5 got solved. then we unlocked the metameta.</p>
  <p>
    we took a while to notice that we were supposed to remove the first letter
    from each word, but afterwards, justin and i started working on the logic
    puzzle, in parallel with some other teammates. we broke it since we missed
    an edge while drawing the graph.
  </p>
  <p>
    finally, we were crowding around the finished diagram when we got to the
    final step of marking the edges of the extra vertex, and we kept being rate
    limited by making guesses when we had half of the letters that we needed.
    this was a great experience though since i saw (and also contributed to) the
    deductions getting worked out in real time.
  </p>
  <p>
    this was the only round where i worked on the final meta, but i was very
    fortunate that it happened to be this round. the round was gimmicked, and
    the exact mechanic of the gimmick was relevant to solving the metameta. i
    really liked the process of realizing that this was how the metas in this
    round worked, even though it did take a while for us to make progress on
    metas despite figuring this out.
  </p>
  <p>
    i definitely have a preference for unconventional (or what teammate calls
    "illegal") puzzles. this can also be shown by the fact that my favorite
    puzzles of all time are gph 2023 and abcdefg final metametas, and&nbsp;
    ship.
  </p>
  <p>
    my preferences for going against conventions also extends to outside
    puzzles. the play-by-post (asynchronous) games of spirit island that i host
    tend to be gimmicked in a way that disrupts the main strategies for many
    spirits. this even extends to real life, where i find someone a lot more
    interesting after finding out that they're lgbtq+ and even more if they're
    trans.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  we finished the last round remaining, murder in mitropolis, around the same
  time we finished the paper trail round, at around 6pm. hq scheduled an
  interaction with us at 7pm, so we just socialized for an hour. then we went to
  the gala.
</p>
<p>
  i think it was kinda funny to see the entirety of teammate walk through the
  gala, though i don't know if anyone else was paying attention to the fact that
  the entire team was there. i decided that i wanted to skip any interactions
  before the runaround, since i wanted to talk to people at the gala, until my
  friends from mit puzzle club urged me to go to the runaround because it was
  starting soon.
</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">the vault</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    i didn't actually participate much in this, i just watched the rest of my
    team line up, each holding an item to make a sound. there were a few funny
    interactions here, such as with the chickens, and someone singing
    <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">this song</a> when the
    radio was playing.
  </p>
</div>
<p>finally, we were let into the vault, and the finale of the plot happened.</p>
<p>
  afterwards, i returned to the gala to continue talking to people from mit
  puzzle club. it was pretty clear that we were the third team to finish, after
  cardinality and providence, and the next two teams were nes and super team
  awesome in some order. a bunch of the other strong teams still had a couple
  metas unfinished, and there were only two hours until the gala closed, which
  means that they would need to finish all the metas soon if they wante a chance
  to do the runaround.
</p>
<p>
  if i had known where other teams' rooms were, i may have visited them that
  night.
</p>

<h2>monday</h2>
<p>
  i again went to campus early and stayed in the banana lounge playing
  nomifactory until around 11. i decided to visit galactic's assigned room at
  around 11 to socialize a bit. yannick was there touching up the tests for
  integration bee which was on tuesday, and there were a few others cleaning up.
  there were a lot of people on galactic that i've never met in person, but i
  recognized some of them despite having never seen their faces.
</p>
<p>
  wrapup didn't have that much for me to write about, since it was mostly about
  puzzles i didn't work on. i did end up finding out what the literal animal
  farm copypasta was at the end, and i think not knowing what it is makes it
  funnier.
</p>
<p>
  after wrapup, we decided that the more-recently-traditional post-wrapup mit
  puzzle club meeting was going to happen on tuesday, so i no longer had plans
  for the afternoon. i was pretty indecisive so i walked to happy lamb with a
  bunch of people from teammate and then crossed the street to get to clover at
  the last minute. i was planning to go to pandemonium afterwards, but i
  accidentally got caught up with flirting with people.
</p>

<h2>reflections</h2>
<p>
  on tuesday, we discussed the future of mit puzzle club, and it sounds like it
  will flourish in the upcoming years, as long as the running team still has
  enough mit students and alumni that know what they're doing. we might even be
  able to do even more stuff next year than this year. there also hasn't been
  any discourse:tm: on mystery hunt in general this year, which is a good sign.
  i'm expecting providence to win in the next couple years, and i believe in
  their ability to keep mystery hunt running well.
</p>
<p>
  it feels like the club just does better when i stop being part of its
  leadership, though i think completing the recovery from covid is the bigger
  reason for its flourishing.
</p>
<p>
  the much earlier first finish this year was very good, but it might have been
  better to have the second place finish not 8 hours later. hopefully next
  year's hunt will have the coin found at a similar time, or even earlier.
  (sunday morning is my preferred time for the coin to be found)
</p>
<p>
  i really liked the gala, as it gave a good channel for socializing with people
  from other teams. however, i was kinda too caught up on solving puzzles to go
  there often. i do kinda wish i had made more visits. there was also a photo
  booth that i didn't use at all.
</p>
<p>
  i never really interacted with the radio, but its existence was quite cool,
  especially as a physical component that could have been used for a lot of
  different things. my main amusement was when two weather reports in a row were
  interrupted by the puzzle solved jingle. i also liked that it played music, as
  i like listening to music while i work (which may not actually make me more
  productive, i just like it)
</p>
<p>
  i find that i always have a desire to write more puzzles right after every
  mystery hunt. let's call that andriddline. my andriddline this year was strong
  enough to make me consider joining cardinality to write again, but there might
  be enough other hunts to write for that can satiate all of that andriddline,
  and i'm pretty sure it also fades over time. in fact, andriddline was the
  reason i joined galactic to write for gph in 2023, and its fading was why i
  didn't actually write any puzzles in gph 2023.
</p>
<p>
  i keep getting crushes on people that i meet at mystery hunt. i have no idea
  how to fix this or whether this is something that warrants fixing.
</p>
<p>oh i also should finish nomifactory</p>
