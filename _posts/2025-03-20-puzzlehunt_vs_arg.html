title: puzzlehunts are not args and vice versa
---

<p>
  recently, a cute girl slid into my dms, and at some point in our conversation
  a question came up about the differences between puzzlehunts and alternate
  reality games (aka args). those two things are very closely related, so here
  are some similarities and differences between (how i view) them.
</p>

<h2>structure of the entire thing</h2>

<p>
  both args and puzzlehunts are made up of puzzles, and your goal is to solve
  the puzzles. you unlock puzzles when you solve other puzzles, and there are
  starting and ending points.
</p>
<p>
  args tend to be linear. one puzzle leads directly to one other puzzle, and
  there is only one puzzle you can work on to make progress. it is often
  difficult to view previous puzzles in the sequence.
</p>
<p>
  puzzlehunts are much more open with what puzzles are available. you usually
  have several puzzles that can be worked on in any order (or even skipped),
  unless you are at the end of a single round of puzzles or at the end of the
  hunt as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  puzzlehunts also have much clearer boundaries between their puzzles, and the
  puzzles almost always have names that are relevant to the puzzle. in
  mainstream puzzlehunts, there is often another page that has a way to access
  all puzzles at once.
</p>

<h2>plot</h2>

<p>
  args tend to be more focused on lore and mystery. puzzlehunts have much more
  varied plots, but the plot does commonly have a mysterious element to it.
</p>

<h2>the puzzles themselves</h2>

<h3>solve paths</h3>

<p>
  a puzzlehunt's puzzles are meant to be solved. the mainstream puzzlehunts have
  their puzzles rigorously tested, and have minimal clues that lead solvers down
  the wrong path ("red herrings"). they are written so that
  <i>most people</i> working on them can solve them.
</p>
<p>
  the puzzles in args vary in difficulty. sometimes, they are meant to be hard,
  and get solved by only a few people in total. other times, they are meant to
  be solved straightforwardly like a puzzle in a puzzlehunt. arg puzzles tend to
  have a lot more red herrings.
</p>
<p>
  puzzlehunt puzzles always have a well-defined solve path, where every step
  either has something in the puzzle cluing it (such as flavortext) or is a
  well-established convention (e.g. crossword clues, various ciphers).
  conventions are used most often for extraction.
</p>
<p>
  arg puzzles have more conventions (e.g. steganography, different ciphers) and
  fewer clues. conventions are much more common for starting puzzles than in
  puzzlehunts, and the clues tend to be more cryptic. this often means that many
  different conventions have to be tried at the beginning at the puzzle before
  you find one that makes progress.
</p>

<h3>answers</h3>

<p>
  puzzlehunt puzzles usually have an answer that is a relatively nice string of
  letters, i.e. a word or phrase. due to this fact, it is usually possible to be
  sure that the correct answer is the correct answer without an answer checker.
  these answers often get used in puzzles of their own, called metapuzzles.
</p>
<p>
  the answer to a puzzle in an arg is the method to get to the next puzzle,
  which usually is taking an action, though it can also be entering a string
  into a submission box like a puzzlehunt puzzle. however, there is less
  guarantee of the string being nice, so it is far harder to be sure of the
  correctness of a password like this.
</p>

<h3>ciphers</h3>

<p>
  any ciphers used in puzzlehunts are usually for extraction, and usually for
  turning non-letter clues (which may be easier to get from the puzzle mechanic)
  into letters. as a consequence, ciphers from letters to other letters such as
  base64 and caesar are far rarer than ciphers from letters to non-letters like
  semaphore, braille, morse, and binary.
</p>
<p>
  puzzlehunts also use a1z26 much more often, which lets the puzzles get letters
  from even more datasets, such as colors through resistor codes, or any set of
  26 things that you can order (swiss cantons, sporadic groups, etc.).
</p>
<p>
  args tend to use ciphers more often, and in more stages of a puzzle. they tend
  to use ciphers from letters to alphanumeric symbols, such as caesar, atbash,
  and binary, more often, which also lets them stack multiple ciphers on top of
  each other more easily.
</p>

<h1>
  so how do you tell whether a puzzle is an arg puzzle or a puzzlehunt puzzle?
</h1>

<p>
  the primary way for me to tell is by looking at it. if i can tell just by
  looking at it that all the information will be useful (including all pictures
  and flavortext), then it is probably a puzzlehunt puzzle. on the other hand,
  if i see that the puzzle is embedded in one picture that i cannot tell whether
  the content of the picture is relevant, it is probably an arg puzzle. note
  that being able to tell whether a picture is relevant comes with experience.
