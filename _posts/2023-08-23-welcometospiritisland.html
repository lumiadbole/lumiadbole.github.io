    welcome to the island <br />
    look at these dahan <br />
    also these invaders treating this place like catan <br />
    we've got mountains and wetlands <br />
    and jungles and sands <br />
    let's fight all these invaders and recover our lands
  </p>
  <p>
    welcome to the island <br />
    make the sun beat down <br />
    you can sweep invaders straight into the sea where they will drown <br />
    turn explorers into wolves overnight <br />
    your shadows flickering will give them some fright
  </p>
  <p>
    welcome to the island <br />
    cause a raging storm <br />
    send a flaming pillar at invaders, they'll feel very warm <br />
    be burning <br />
    be flooding <br />
    be melting the ground <br />
    or wash away explorers, push them around
  </p>
  <p>
    welcome to the island <br />
    make a frightful scream <br />
    here's a new piece of the island that you once thought was a dream <br />
    we've got earthquakes, tsunamis, and rocks in the ground <br />
    and a bunch of complications where you weave two different lands together
    and they become one land for everything
  </p>
  <p>
    welcome to the island <br />
    your tree is very tall <br />
    make invaders try to run their plows into the thorny wall <br />
    you can let a swarm of locusts <br />
    wipe out all their crops <br />
    or have your tigers turn their builders to chops
  </p>
  <p>
    see the island changing <br />
    be insightful, take a sun <br />
    make invaders very mad and <br />
    shoot each other with their guns
  </p>
  <p>
    start the rumor of their doom or <br />
    make volcanoes go kaboom or <br />
    choke invaders with a shroom or <br />
    smell a fume or cause a bloom or burn their
  </p>
  <p>
    here's the healthy island event <br />
    we've stopped all the blight <br />
    here's a very useless fear card <br />
    the dahan put up a fight
  </p>
  <p>
    which force of nature are you <br />
    playing with this game <br />
    this island has some spirits that will <br />
    cause in va ders shame
  </p>
  <p>
    we're destroying them with everything <br />
    all of the time <br />
    killing them with everything <br />
    all of the time <br />
    invaders causing tragedies <br />
    but nature's fixing crime <br />
    anything and everything <br />
    all of the time

  </p>
  <p>
    you know, it wasn't always like this <br />
    not very long ago <br />
    just before your time <br />
    right before invaders came, everything was fine
  </p>
  <p>
    you're a peaceful lake <br />
    which we'd take <br />
    a small sip or two <br />
    we set our sights and spent our nights <br />
    hanging near you, you, the beautiful you
  </p>
  <p>
    then ships landed on the island <br />
    there were barely two <br />
    and they did all the things <br />
    we're afraid they would do
  </p>
  <p>
    now look at you, oh <br />
    look at you, you, you <br />
    you're bleeding and wounded too <br />
    our time is now <br />
    we're watching out <br />
    look at how they grew
  </p>
  <p>
    and if we stick together <br />
    who knows what we'll do <br />
    it was never the plan <br />
    but now the world's in our hands
  </p>
  <p>*nervous laughter blending into evil laughter*</p>
  <p>
    we're destroying them with everything <br />
    all of the time <br />

    welcome to the island <br />
    have a look around <br />
    anything that randomly can happen can be found <br />
    there are mountains and wetlands <br />
    and jungles and sands <br />
    we tried to colonize this place, but nature's got hands
  </p>
  <p>
    welcome to the island <br />
    the sun is beating down <br />
    there are currents sweeping you into the sea where you will drown <br />
    your friends are turning into wolves overnight <br />
    the stars don't like you so don't follow their light
  </p>
  <p>
    welcome to the island <br />
    hide from lightning strikes <br />
    the trees are sharp and glossy, they'll impale you with their spikes <br />
    we're burning <br />
    we're drowning <br />
    we're sinking in mud <br />
    this river has a massive seasonal flood
  </p>
  <p>
    welcome to the island <br />
    don't listen to that scream <br />
    well our neighbor city vanished, looks like they were just a dream <br />
    we've got earthquakes, tsunamis, and beasts in the ground <br />
    and this stone is very hard to mine and we're breaking ourselves trying to
    quarry any resources from it
  </p>
  <p>
    welcome to the island <br />
    this tree is very tall <br />
    be careful you don't run your plows into the thorny wall <br />
    there are lots of scary monsters <br />
    coming from the sea <br />
    this peaceful lake is now devouring me
  </p>
  <p>
    see a tree exploding <br />
    get attacked while finding gold <br />
    follow others who act like you <br />
    here are monsters, you'll get rolled
  </p>
  <p>
    start the rumor of your doom or <br />
    hear volcanoes go kaboom or <br />
    see the flowers in full bloom or <br />
    smell a fume or eat a shroom or get a
  </p>
  <p>
    here's a place that's quickly rotting <br />
    natives killed your wife <br />
    there's a group of tigers hunting <br />
    here's a flower causing strife
  </p>
  <p>
    which force of nature are you <br />
    falling victim to <br />
    this island sends disasters just for <br />
    ter ror i zing you

  <p>
    they're bombarding us with everything <br />
    all of the time <br />
    scaring us with everything <br />
    all of the time <br />
    nature's causing tragedies <br />
    like we've committed crime <br />
    anything and everything <br />

    right before the city fell, 1599
  </p>
  <p>
    we were finding fault <br />
    mining salt <br />
    a crystal or two <br />
    we set our sights and spent our nights <br />
    digging it through, and we found something too
  </p>
  <p>
    we just landed on the island <br />
    it was fairly new <br />
    and we did all the things <br />
    that we wanted to do

    unstoppable, watchable <br />
