  i wrote an rgb puzzle, primarily inspired by my efforts writing the
  minesweeper round of teammate hunt. since you can't express purple with binary
  amounts of rgb, it was not very hard to choose which flags to use in the
  puzzle.

  main page for the pride showcase is at

  note: the grid in the penpa link doesn't look as good as this preview since
  penpa has a more limited selection of colors
