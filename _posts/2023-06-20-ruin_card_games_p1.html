title: "how to ruin card games, part 1: general principles"
---

<p>
  there are a ton of aspects people like and dislike about card games. i asked a
  couple of my communities about this and got some responses: (an extremely
  non-comprehensive list)
</p>

<p>dislikes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>trading card games are very expensive.</li>
  <li>lack of strategy</li>
  <li>bluffing, or something specific to a game</li>
  <li>rules that are too complicated</li>
  <li>consistently losing</li>
  <li>not having enough people</li>
</ol>

<p>likes:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>complex strategy</li>
  <li>simplicity</li>
  <li>demonstrating skills</li>
  <li>teamwork</li>
</ol>

<p>
  given that they're asking you to play a game you don't really like, they may
  already have the issue of #6, so just not playing or leaving the game is
  probably enough to ruin it for them. however, if you want to ruin the game
  some other way, or you decide that you want to ruin the game some time into
  playing, the tips offered in the upcoming parts will help with that.
