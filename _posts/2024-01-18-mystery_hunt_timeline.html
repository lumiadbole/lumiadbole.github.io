<h2>hunt itself</h2>
<p>
  i felt like i didn't do that much during hunt this year, partially since the
  early rounds felt quite lacking in logic puzzles, and i didn't feel like doing
  the research puzzles when someone else could do them much more easily.
</p>

<p>
  that's a pretty big difference in the dynamics of small and large teams. when
  i work in a smaller team, i'm more willing to do research puzzles, since there
  are fewer teammates to do them for me, and they're also less likely to prefer
  to be the one doing them.
</p>

<p>
  i was also kinda touch starved all of mystery hunt. next time i need to either
  bring some plushies to teammate's hq or find someone i can cuddle while doing
  puzzles (such as by pulling my gf onto teammate).
</p>

<h4>puzzles i worked on, spoilers for all of these</h4>

</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    i jumped on this pretty quickly. i don't normally do number placement, but
    this was interesting enough (and the only logic puzzle available) that i
    solved the entire kakuro, and then i let my teammates extract for me since i
    didn't feel like processing the 11-12 length strings that i ended up with.
  </p>
  <p>
    the logic puzzle was quite hard, because it was hard to see all the
    possibilities of how the letters could be divided into roman numerals, but
    that made any insights i made more fun.
  </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">arts and crafts</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    of course, my favorite puzzle in the entire hunt because of its theme. i
    also learned how to use structure blocks just for this puzzle.
  </p>
  <p>
    i didn't make the extraction aha, but i corrected the work that my teammate
    did with extraction by noticing that two lamps had redstone torches and not
    dusts on top of them.
  </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">flamingo</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    the initial aha was hard, but after figuring out how to get 3 single-digit
    numbers to multiply to 181, the rest of the puzzle became doable and quite
    fun, despite being composed of number placement genres. i enjoyed writing
    letters instead of numbers in the boxes. i did the entire thing in snipping
    tool, without needing to assemble anything.
  </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">marathon block pushing game</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    as someone who studies complexity theory, pushing blocks and sokoban is
    something i've had a lot of exposure to, and i understood what was going on
    pretty quickly, though i didn't quite feel like calculating the minimum
    number of moves for a solution myself, so i let a teammate do it. i had fun
    with the part at the end, designing the 20x20 puzzle that needed more than
    1000 moves to complete. it was good that the beginning of the puzzle primed
    us for that part.
  </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">junky logic</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    i worked on this with a teammate. annoyingly, the website sometimes stopped
    working when both of us were working on it at the same time, so we instead
    just used my computer to see what the letters did and his to do the actual
    puzzle. we did the first 4 rows together, and then he ended up finishing the
    puzzle because we figured out all the rules at like midnight and i wanted to
    sleep.
  </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">jigsaw slitherlink</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    putting stuff together with a teammate was quite fun, and my initial insight
    into how the puzzle worked was the tile with the phi^-4. we had fun figuring
    out how the tesselations worked, including just drawing diagonal lines where
    there weren't any, and finding out where the 3 in the diagonal square went.
  </p>
  <p>
    this puzzle took up like all of sunday, since there were so many parts.
    after assembling it, i did about 60% of the slitherlink and didn't have the
    necessary analysis background/fractals knowledge to finish.

<h1>the year before that</h1>

<p>
  so this is roughly what the timeline of a mystery hunt looks like.
  <b>bold</b> text will be stuff that can only be done by mit puzzle club.
  <b><i>bold italicized</i></b> stuff must be done either by an mit student on
  the writing team who is also on puzzle club, or by spoiling someone on puzzle
  club.
</p>
<p>
  this is by no means exhaustive and will depend on the people on both puzzle
  club and the writing team.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    a couple days after mystery hunt: the writing and winning teams meet
    together with mit puzzle club to pass on knowledge
  </li>
  <li>
    before february: figure out who on the team will actually be writing, also
    elect important leadership positions such as benevolent dictators,
    editors-in-chief, story/art directors, etc.
  </li>
  <li>mid-february: decide on a theme</li>
  <li>
    <b>
      late february: book kresge for kickoff and rooms in the student center for
      events.
    </b>
    the bookings are for specific days, so past this point the days that mystery
    hunt happens on cannot be moved.
  </li>
  <li>some point early in the year: figure out how to get sponsors</li>
  <li>
    i'm not actually sure when, maybe march-ish?: have the metas completed and
    make feeder answers exist
  </li>
  <li><b> sometime in the spring: puzzle club leadership changes </b></li>
  <li>april-august (and also later): write and testsolve puzzles</li>
  <li>
    late august: make sure you're back in contact with mit puzzle club, and the
    new leadership
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>late august: make sure you're back in contact with the writing team</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>sometime in september: reserve the bush room, to use as hunt hq.</b> i
    don't remember when this can be done, but we should try to do this earlier
    so there's less of a chance of the bush room being reserved at a time
    overlapping hunt (though i do think there are some groups that get priority,
    such as any admin meetings). the bush room is like the canonical hq for
    organizing teams, as it's in a very centralized place on main campus.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>mid-september: hotel block stuff that i don't fully understand</b> but
    basically get the nearby hotels to offer discounted rooms for people staying
    over for mystery hunt
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
      late september: figure out what you want the minors policy at mystery hunt
      to be.
    </b>
    then you may need to talk to the student organization, leadership, and
    engagement office about it depending on what the policy is, the more closely
    accompanied minors are, the less you have to talk.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
      <i>
        late october: make sure events are fully planned, then meet with campus
        activities complex and emergency medical services to make sure that the
        events don't cause problems
      </i>
    </b>
  </li>
  <li>
    late october: release the hunt registration website. it'd be very funny if
    this was done at the exact same time cmu hunt releases their hunt
    registration website (i'm not saying you should try to do this, i'm just
    saying that it would be funny that one time it did happen)
  </li>
  <li>november 1: most puzzles should be drafted by now</li>
  <li>all of november: factcheck puzzles</li>
  <li>
    <b>
      early november: establish a point of contact to reserve classrooms from
      both the main group of buildings and from individual departments
    </b>
    these are the important mit people that are the least stressful to talk to,
    they also respond pretty quickly. we want basically as many non-lecture hall
    classrooms as possible, plus 26-100 (the largest lecture hall) on monday for
    wrapup. we also want a room for the how to hunt workshop and also rooms for
    any writing team meetings on campus right before hunt.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b> late november: register events on atlas so they can be approved </b> and
    tim tickets can exist. registering events on atlas requires them to have a
    location set, so this should be done after classrooms are reserved
  </li>
  <li>late november: finalize coin design</li>
  <li>december 1: most puzzles should be factchecked by now</li>
  <li>the first half of december: postprod puzzles</li>
  <li>
    <b>
      <i>
        mid december: talk to e33 (lighting services), mit video productions,
        and mit audiovisual services to assist with technological stuff for
        kickoff and wrapup. e33 may also be useful for events and/or runarounds
        if you want special lighting for them.
      </i>
    </b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
      <i>
        also mid december: make sure all planned purchases are finalized, then
        buy everything (physical puzzles, event props, etc) that needs to be
        bought using puzzle club's money.
      </i>
    </b>
    this includes stuff you give to teams like first aid kits and nametags
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
      late december: make sure rooms and attached hunters are assigned to teams
    </b>
    (things can still be changed after this point, but make sure there's a
    preliminary assignment)
  </li>
  <li>
    late december: in a perfect universe, a full-hunt testsolve, though this is
    very difficult to facilitate
  </li>
  <li>
    <b> 1-2 weeks before hunt: advertise the how to hunt workshop </b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
      1-2 weeks before hunt: talk to custodial services about what kind of
      cleaning of the classrooms you want them to do during hunt.
    </b>
    importantly, we don't want them erasing chalkboards.
  </li>
  <li><b> 1 week before hunt: set up tim tickets </b></li>
  <li>a couple days before hunt: set up the hunt phones</li>
  <li>day of hunt: hunt!</li>
</ul>

<p>
  of course, stuff will always get delayed, because nobody will be perfect. so a
  lot of stuff will get pushed to the week before hunt, making that week
  especially hectic.
</p>

<h1>the year after that</h1>

<p>
  once hunt ends, there's still a few things that need to be done. puzzle club
  and the writing team need to compile some stuff for the winning team. we pass
  down stuff like budgets, timelines, classroom lists, and advice, and invite
  the winning team to ask us questions in a handoff meeting.
</p>
<p>
  if you were like teammate and cut puzzles from hunt, you should release them
  at some point. you can do this either as a hunt on their own or with a hunt
  re-written around them. these were the two options that teammate had with
  abcdefg (tbh we should just have more hunts with the difficulty of abcdefg)
</p>
<p>
  the last thing the writing team needs to do is host the how to hunt workshop
  for next year's mystery hunt, which is generally done in the week before hunt.
</p>
<p>
  supposedly there's also an advisory board, composed of representatives from
  the last 5-ish writing teams, but i don't think i've been maintaining it well
  enough.
</p>
