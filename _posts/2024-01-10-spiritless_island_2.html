title: defeating level 6s with no spirits!?
---

<p>
  so the invaders from the
  <a href="/si_theory/2023/12/29/spiritless_island.html">previous post</a>
  decided to ask brandenburg-prussia for help invading the island. they
  convinced the kingdom to send all of its most efficient troops to the island.
</p>

<p>
  when they got to the island, they found that it was reverted to its state
  before, with all of the environmental damage they did earlier reverted, and
  the dahan have moved back to where they were at the beginning. the mosquitoes
  and the flock of birds have both returned to where they were before. the
  invaders established a couple of settlements on the island, in the same places
  they had before, with an extra one on the coast for good measure.
</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">how did they fare?</button>
<div class="content">
  <ul>
    <li><i>start on board d</i></li>
    <li>
      the invaders head for the lush areas of the island first, to start farming
      and chopping trees so they'll be more prepared for exploring the rest of
      the island later.
      <br />
      <i>initial explore jwetlands</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      after farming and chopping trees for a year, the invaders decide to scout
      out good places on the shores for ports so they can receive overseas
      support more easily.
      <br />
      <i>turn 1 build jwetlands, explore coastal</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      sometime next year, sweden, prussia's enemy, decides to attack prussia's
      colony on this island. the prussians here rally together in a wave of
      nationalism, but since there are no spirits to help blunt the offensive,
      sweden gets to wreak havoc on the invaders' biggest settlement.
      <br />
      <i>
        turn 2 event is far-off wars, destruction is encouraged, destroying town
        city in d3 and adding 2 blight (7 fear total)
      </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the attack also destroys the environment around that area, making it
      harder to live in.
      <br />
      <i>ecosystem damage adds a badlands to d3</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      seeing as this is their chance, the dahan in d5 move down to the coastal
      jungle to threaten the invaders there.
      <br />
      <i>
        return to old pillars gathers d5 dahan to d2 <br />
        daunted by the dahan generates 1 fear, and invaders deal 6 less damage
        to dahan (8 fear total)
      </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the invaders conclude that spending more of their efforts trading overseas
      is safer.
      <br />
      <i>overseas trade seems safer defends 3 in all coastal lands</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the dahan in d1 and d2 are angry at the invaders taking their land, and
      attack.
      <br />
      <i>
        ravage jwetlands, dahan counterattacks clear d1 and destroy explorer
        city in d2 (11 fear total)
      </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the invaders feel that their willingness to farm on the island has
      decreased, as they consume more and more of the island's resources. <br />
      <i>erosion of will flips, generating 2 fear (13 fear total)</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      they still build ports, but the dahan attack means that the invaders have
      not nearly as many resources as before, so their ports are no longer
      extensive.
      <br />
      <i> build coastal</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the invaders decide to stop wasting time and go into the deserts to look
      for gold. they feel that they were close enough to finding gold last time
      that they want to try again. the invaders also try to reclaim some land in
      d1.
      <br />
      <i>explore sescalate, escalate in d1</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the next few years pass by, and the island goes through a long drought.
      there are no spirits to ease the drought, so the land withers and the
      plants die. <br />
      <i>
        turn 3 event is years of little rain, the plants die and the land
        withers, no blight is added, invaders and dahan have 1 less health
      </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the birds in d3 are dying of thirst, and in their last breaths, attack the
      invaders in d3 trying to find water, but to no avail. <br /><i>
        beasts attack wipes d3, the beast is removed (14 fear total)
      </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the dahan know where to get water, and are making sure that the invaders
      don't get to it <br /><i>canny defense defends 1 per dahan</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the explorer in d4 is feeling alone, and is too thirsty to continue
      exploring <br /><i>isolation removes the explorer from d4</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the invaders scour the coasts for water, and destroy a dahan village, but
      don't find it and die from thirst and dahan retaliation <br /><i>
        ravage coastal, 1 dahan in d2 dies, dahan counterattacks wipe d1 and d2
        (16 fear total)
      </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      despite being in a very dry place, the invaders somehow build up their
      settlement in d7 <br />
      <i>build sands, adding a city in d7 </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the invaders go back to the wetlands to try and find more water. they try
      a third time to reclaim some land in d1.
      <br /><i>explore wescalate, escalate in d1</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the invaders realize that the dahan are a pretty big problem, and try to
      conscript some to help them colonize the island. however, the current
      groups of dahan that are easily convertible are too big, so that fails.
      <br />
      <i> turn 4 event is cultural assim, the top part fails </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the dahan are angry that the invaders would try to convert them, and
      attack the invaders themselves without paying attention to the
      environment. <br />
      <i>
        reckless offensive destroys town city in d7 and adds a blight (19 fear
        total)
      </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      people in the inland town are upset at receiving low wages, so they form a
      strike and tear the town apart.
      <br />
      <i>
        angry mobs replaces the d6 town with 2 explorers, generating 1 fear (20
        fear total, reaching terror 2)
      </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the town in d1 decide that it is safer for them to learn from the dahan,
      and adopt their lifestyle. they give up all of their allegiance to
      prussia.
      <br />
      <i> mimic the dahan replaces the d1 town with a dahan </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      the invaders have lost all settlements on the island, and their morale is
      not strong enough to continue colonizing the island. the surviving
      explorers all leave the island and go back to prussia.
      <br />
      <i> terror 2 victory! </i>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
  these invaders try this again with 4 other countries, and none of them
  succeeded. one country even tried two different tactics, and both resulted in
  failures.

  just give the game details below. they all start on board d.
