title: mit girlkiss -- er, mystery hunt 2026
---

<h2>before hunt</h2>

<p>
  there was some drama that i won't get into more detail on. for related
  reasons, i volunteered to be part of hunt ops (i.e. making team-wide decisions
  about our puzzle-solving strategy)
</p>

<p>
  around the end of november, may, one of my then-crushes, asked me how to join
  teammate. i sent her teammate's registration form, and she was invited a few
  days later. this will be important later.
</p>

<p>
  in mid-december, i discovered that teammate has several people into modded
  minecraft, including may. this made me consider starting a new modded server
  for teammate. i held off on deciding until after time passes day.
</p>

<p>
  close to time passes day, tas (one of my girlfriends) shared a "girlkisser
  wrapped", which made many of us in puzzlers club decide to start competing to
  see who could kiss the most girls in 2026.
</p>

<p>
  the day after time passes night, i decided (read: was reminded (read:
  pestered) by may) to actually start the minecraft server. i first tried to
  boot up enigmatica 2 expert unofficial skybound, but the world generation
  failed to be skybound. i then switched to project ozone 3 because it was
  easier to boot up. this server was supposed to be for all of teammate, but in
  practice i and may were the only people who played on the server before
  mystery hunt. i think the others were otherwise unavailable because they were
  on vacation away from their computers or something.
</p>

<h2>meeting people</h2>

<p>
  on thursday, i went to le meridian. there was nobody there while i was there.
  so i decided to then go to the banana lounge like last year. i met a terminal
  there, and i just sat across from them for 2 hours playing minecraft while
  they played blue prince. i suggested sitting across from them so i wouldn't
  get spoiled. (i haven't played it at all; my only exposure to the game was
  from gph 2025 which i have yet to write about) i did notice that they were
  writing in a notebook while playing, which is something i have done for
  factory modpacks like monifactory and will prepare to do for gtnh, but not yet
  for a puzzle game.
</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>
    afterwards, i went to go cuddle with tas, elara (my metamour), may (who by
    then was my metametamour), and nicholai (who i am close with but not
    dating). we [sexually explicit content redacted] boobs. during this session,
    i was reminded that i needed to update my play-by-post, and that started a
    conversation about spirit island. (for all you monoamorous people out there,
    "metamour" means range 2 on the relationship graph, and "metametamour" means
    range 3)
  </p>

  <p>
    i was at 3 girls kissed at the start of this session. by the end, i went up
    to 7.
  </p>

  <p>
    near the beginning of the cuddling, may asked me if i wanted to actually
    date. given that i had been crushing on her for like over 6 months, you can
    probably guess what i said.
  </p>

  <p>
    the funniest interaction that happened: (probably not exactly like this but
    it gets the point across)
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>tas: i won't have much girlkissing to do until may</li>
    <li>may: what?</li>
    <li>tas: there is a lot of fun to be had within may</li>
    <li>may: what?</li>
    <li>elara: she has a lot of gay shit to do in may</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    may also asked me whether i'd be "upgrading seeds" while cuddling. i
    successfully avoided doing so.
  </p>
  <p>
    i accidentally forgot my hat in their hotel room, making this the second
    time i've left a hat while visiting a metametamour.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  afterwards was a teammate social meeting. i spent most of the time being very
  bad at the crew.
</p>

<p>
  on friday, i went to flour for the traditional puzzlers club meetup. this
  time, there were 62 people in the picture, which was a lot more than the 36 of
  last year. i made the mistake of taking off my mask, so my face was absolutely
  freezing. idk if my face freezing was worth the small amount of girlkissing
  that i did, especially since my number didn't increase that morning.
</p>

<p>
  after that was the teammate meetup at other flour. i ate some food there
  because i didn't have enough time to get food at the first flour.
</p>

<h2>puzzles</h2>

<p>
  i kinda didn't look at the <s>projection device</s> monquest basically at all
  this weekend. i mainly focused on solving the puzzles that were unlocked
  instead of discovering new puzzles to unlock. since i was part of ops, i also
  unlocked some of the puzzles that the team voted to unlock, and sent messages
  for each puzzle that people could discord react to if they wanted to unlock.
</p>

<p>
  may kinda stuck with me for the entire hunt, so a lot of the puzzles that i
  looked at, i worked with her on. because of her, i also did not get touch
  starved during hunt this year, except late at night when she went back to her
  hotel room to sleep while i was still puzzling.

    i figured out pretty quickly that the first kenken needed numbers 2, 3, 20,
    and 4. the rest of the kenkens were solved quickly afterwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    the extracted phrase was something about puzzlepix, which i wasn't quite
    sure what to do with, so i jumped to another puzzle.

    for most of this puzzle, we thought that the second picture was something
    like "bricking". i looked closer at the "bricks" and figured out that those
    looked edible. then i realized that that picture should have been "fudging".

    i was working on land of no name when i heard people talking about mandarin,
    and they told me they were working on this puzzle. it was almost finished by
    the time i looked at the mandarin part, so i instead looked at the rest of
    this puzzle. a teammate said that the web part was easily qatable,
    especially the final answer with a lot of repeated letters. i stole one of
    his queries for an earlier web and modified it for the final web. (i'm not
    that familiar with qat but i can remember how queries work if prompted)

    this was the first of many puzzles where i noticed the extraction being just
    drawing out the letters on some sort of grid. i like this type of
    extraction, except that the h we kept thinking was an m until i looked at it
    again and was like "wait isn't this an h"

    may discovered that these were transparent minesweepers, so we kinda raced
    to finish these. this once again had squares painting out letters, so we
    extracted those letters. we then got stuck on what to do with those letters,
    so i decided to switch puzzles yet again.

    i wolfram alphaed some of these numbers first and concluded from some
    variant of engineer's induction that they were all prime. so then i saw that
    they were all 1 mod 4 (supported by the flavortext), which means that you
    could write all of them as a sum of squares (this is one of the few number
    theory facts that i remember). i wrote some python to evaluate them, and
    then may made my code 100000 times faster by adding a line that just read
    <br />
    "squares = set(squares)".
  </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">pixel grid (s)</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>this was the only puzzle that i completely soloed.</p>
  <p>
    i realized pretty quickly that this was a 2d grid of squares and that this
    was meant to be pixel art. i was able to assemble the first 3 images with
    only letters g, i, j, m, q, z unlocked, and it made a black cat, a broken
    mirror, and a friday the 13th on a calendar, which i recognized all as signs
    of bad luck.
  </p>
  <p>
    the pictures had some differences from the correct pictures, in that the cat
    didn't have a tail and also only two distinguishable legs and the calendar
    actually said "fai 13" instead of "fri 13", but it was pretty clear that
    "fri" was intended.
  </p>
  <p>
    however, i couldn't get anywhere on the last picture for extraction, so i
    waited for some more puzzles to get solved.
  </p>
  <p>
    in the meantime, some teammates looked at the work i did on the puzzle, and
    they liked the cat drawing i deduced.
  </p>
  <img src="/assets/img/kbity.png" />
  <p>
    after o, u, and x got solved afterwards, i was able to assemble the first
    half of the last picture into 3 question marks. afterwards, i started
    assembling the second half of the picture, and i noticed that it was
    probably going to be 4 question marks.
  </p>
  <p>
    "oh fucking hell", i yelled out loud in my mind. then i called in "bad luck"
    and yelled out loud in real life "i solved s".

    by the time we were making good progress on this puzzle, all vowels except e
    were solved. i had already recognized these as pangrams, so i just needed to
    figure out what to do with them.
  </p>
  <p>
    fortunately, one of the pangrams solved to "the quick brown ox jumps over
    the lazy dog" which was a pretty obvious clue for what the extraction was
    going to be.

  <p>
    i did some of the work and managed to string some of the stuff together.
    however, i only did a small part of this puzzle and it might not have even
    been correct. this was the first puzzle that teammate spent large amounts of
    energy on.
  </p>
  <p>
    maybe i should look at this puzzle more. however, i'm already pretty bad at
    looking at puzzles after hunts including them have ended, so i guess i will
    need to be reminded at some point. i also think it's pretty hard to do solo.

    holy shit these logic puzzles were so hard. i solved the heya/aqre and the
    ripple/putteria fully logically, and got about halfway through
    lookair/5cells before i saw that it was solved by someone else. this puzzle
    is what i was working on as i went to sleep on friday night.
  </p>
  <p>
    may intuited the balance/shikaku after 3 tries and solved the water
    walk/double choco. how so good at intuition :pleading_face:
  </p>
  <p>
    i do need to get better at guessing in logic puzzles. i find that it is very
    effective when i do logic puzzle contests to just start guessing immediately
    when i get stuck, but i also think this is not generally how i enjoy logic
    puzzles.

  <p>
    i saw may looking at this puzzle while i was extracting setting boundaries.
    i watched her code up a program to solve the einstein, and then try to find
    issues as the program returned no results that follow all 9 rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    the parsing may had of the 9th rule (which turned out to be the intended
    parsing) didn't seem right to me, but i couldn't think of a better way to
    parse it so i just agreed.

    i noticed pretty much immediately that each clue has the same number of

    a bit before starting this puzzle, may had a headache, so i brought her to
    the banana lounge to sleep. i brought my laptop to continue working on
    puzzles. someone on the team just knew the fact about citrus fruit ancestry,
    and i proceeded to solve the hashis on a beanbag in banana lounge with may
    sleeping on my chest.

    i did a relatively small amount of work on solving the clues. instead, my
    main contribution to this puzzle was after the clues were all solved, where
    i drew the connections we had on the blackboard in our room. i noticed that
    it was basically a binary tree with every edge directed from left to right.
    there were a few clues near the root that didn't seem right, but we fixed
    those and extracted immediately.

    when i and may got back to teammate's hq from banana lounge, a teammate
    burst into the room and said that this puzzle was about pride flags. i
    immediately said "damn i should have come back sooner", and a different
    teammate said "yeah you probably know more than we do". it was mildly
    unfortunate timing that two of the gayest people on teammate were away when
    this puzzle was being worked on.

    i recognized which puzzle this was referencing immediately because it was a

    first aquarium hunt i've encountered. however, i did not know how this
    puzzle changed the mechanics of the bridge or the islands.

    i and may were working on this together. i think i was significantly faster
    than her at actually solving the slitherlinks though, so when we got to the
    small ones i went to work on a different puzzle while she intuited her way
    through them.
  </p>
  <p>
    i also asked for a hint on the meta. the "you can't get anything by looking
    at just one subpuzzle" statement was very helpful.

    i and may worked on separate puzzles on this round, until we got to the
    meta. i suspected this was a system of equations where the variables were
    the letters and the totals were the costs. she coded up a program to solve
    this system. since there were 23 different foods and 22 different letters,
    we just used the last food as verification, which was the cantalope.
  </p>
  <p>
    it gave a non-integer cost for the cantalope. then i realized that the
    apricot was actually a papaya.
  </p>
  <p>
    it again gave a non-integer cost for the cantalope. then may realized that
    the plum was actually a grape.
  </p>
  <p>
    it again gave a non-integer cost for the cantalope. we then realized that we
    were spelling "cantaloupe" wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
    we still had a non-integer cost. we tried respelling "doughnut" to "donut".
  </p>
  <p>
    the cantaloupe cost 32 instead of 16. may tried writing it as "melon"
    instead.
  </p>
  <p>it worked!</p>
  <p>
    and all we had to do left was to find the costs of the answers to our
    shopping lists. we ended up with "hi?dtege pisginph" (where the ? was -13),
    which i anagrammed to "weighted shipping".

  i noticed the cross- prefixes pretty quickly. after solving most of the clues,

<h2>sunday night</h2>

<p>
  i went to sleep at a normal time on sunday night, while some teammates
  continued doing puzzles. they became too exhausted at 6am, so we decided to
  give up on finishing before wrapup.
</p>

<h2>after hunt</h2>

<p>
  i was kinda late to wrapup, so i had to stand at the back for the entire
  thing. fortunately, i was with may and elara and a bunch of others from
  society of spirits. i wanted to talk to the people from society of spirits,
  but didn't really have time to between wrapup and going to eat lunch. maybe i
  should hunt with them on a smaller puzzlehunt during the year (since i would
  probably rather not leave teammate for mystery hunt).
</p>

<p>
  after wrapup, may wanted to kiss another girl that we met, but she was too
  nervous to ask her if it was ok. i was considering asking for her, but i was
  some combination of also too nervous and didn't care enough about my personal
  girlkisser score to ask. (i believe she would have said yes if we did actually
  ask, which is maybe unfortunate)
</p>

<p>
  in the modded minecraft server, i obtained a weapon that deals 200 damage (not
  counting buffs from astral sorcery), and used it a couple times while killing
  ender dragons with may, while she was just throwing shurikens that dealt like
  10-20 damage. her reaction was to say "lumia and may solving logic puzzles,
  2026, colorized".
</p>

<p>girls :pleading_face:</p>

<p>
  anyways, time to continue playing modded minecraft. i and may and some others
  are starting a gtnh server soon, so see y'all in 4000 hours.
</p>
