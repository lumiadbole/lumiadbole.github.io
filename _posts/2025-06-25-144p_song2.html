<p>parody of hotel california</p>

<p>
  in a bright desert inland, in mauritius isle <br />
  removing invaders is gonna take a while <br />
  in the general convos, one strategy came to light <br />
  i went to follow the discussions there, it wasn't hard to do right <br />
  there he stood on the books isle, i read the long term plan <br />
  and i was thinking to myself, this could be super fun, i am a fan <br />
  then we gave him a prolif and his incarna came here <br />
  there were finders pushing things to us, i thought i heard them say
</p>
<p>
  welcome to the lair lair corporation <br />
  where the spirits play <br />
  support cards all day <br />
  send your invaders to lair lair corporation <br />
  any time of year <br />
  they'll be useful here
</p>
<p>
  our turns are both getting coded, we got the github repo, uh <br />
  we got a call and double lair innates that make us grow <br />
  we have instruments threshold, blur ravages <br />
  we update the inputs, the code gives a list <br />
  then we called up the finders, "move your presence there" <br />
  they said "we want to use our powers to save dahan everywhere" <br />
  and the volcanoes erupting from far away <br />
  added sixty explorers to our base, as we hear them say
</p>
<p>
  welcome to the lair lair corporation <br />
  where the spirits play <br />
  support cards all day <br />
  give me a weave with the lair lair corporation <br />
  we will solve your lands <br />
  take them off your hands
</p>
<p>
  there's 6 extra ghost boards, robot's coastline cast down <br />
  and we said, "there are many side quests and goals, we can go to town" <br />
  and all of the incarna, have gathered for a feast <br />
  they're woven onto lightning isle, with a metal-holding beast <br />
  last thing i remember, we were paying for event <br />
  we had to give a presence back, but my partner overspent <br />
  "relax", said the love host, "we choose what we perceive <br />
  you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"
</p>
