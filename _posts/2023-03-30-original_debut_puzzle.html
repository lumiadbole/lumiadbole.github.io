this is a "liar^3" "knapp-daneban" heya that i posted on twitter a long time ago
(as in, january 2021, over 2 years ago) <br />

both the "liar^3" and the "knapp-daneban" are in quotes, because both of the
terms are used slightly incorrectly. <br />

deusovi explained this much better than i did, so roughly in deusovi's words:
<br />
one row is wrong, one column is wrong, no numbers are off by exactly 1 <br />
rows and columns being wrong will flip all borders for the heyawake rule, but
the number clues care about the original regions <br />
