<p>
  while working on story for abcdefg, i (with jacqui's and liam's indirect help)
  had several ideas for how we would explain the existence of abcdefg. here were
  some of the ideas that i had, refined slightly:
</p>
<h2>version 1:</h2>
<p>
  it is the very early morning of january 16, 2023. <br />
  your team has just solved the first wyrm meta.
</p>
<p>
  you have unlocked a new round. it looks pretty cool, the entire round is
  monospaced ascii art, and the puzzles look pretty fun. you get drawn to it
  immediately.
</p>
<p>you start solving the puzzles, and unlock more. you continue solving...</p>
<p>oh no. this newly unlocked puzzle is 6 gb in size...</p>
<p>this one here is really hard to research...</p>
<p>
  and this one wants us to fully learn the rules of a super complicated game.
</p>
<p>
  i won't be able to finish any of these before wrap-up <br />
  there might still be additional rounds after this one, but we've only solved 2
  puzzles in this round...
</p>
<p>
  our hint request is stuck somewhere and it won't return for another hour
  because it's 4am in the morning...
</p>
<p>
  you almost scream. then you wake up in a sweat... <br />
  it was all a dream.
</p>
<h3>or was it?</h3>

<hr />

<h2>version 2:</h2>

<p>the four AIs are all on vacation.</p>
<p>
  you suspect that eye is on a world tour, and conjuri is still working on their
  game. <br />
  bootes is apparently exploring the universe. <br />
  you've also seen both mate and wyrm fairly recently.
</p>
<p>suddenly, you receive a call for help from cyberspace. <br /></p>
