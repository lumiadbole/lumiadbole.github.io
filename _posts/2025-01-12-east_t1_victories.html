title: turn 1 victories on east board
---

<h1>section 1: intro</h1>

<p>
  after thinking about sunshine on board east, i thought "hmm, what else can you
  do with dahan counterattacks on board east?"
</p>

<h1>section 2: the process of figuring this out</h1>

<p>
  so saltsburg 1 is something that i've used in my previous post to cause
  ravages on turn 1 in east3. however, there are 3 dahan in east4, and also no
  disease, so we can also try to cause a ravage there.
</p>

<p>
  if we also use haunts and embers, we can push stuff from east3 to east4. if we
  push just the town, then the east4 counterattack will destroy it. however,
  that leaves the east3 city and the east2 town for the spirit and 1 fear card
  and 1 blight card to deal with, and destroying all those buildings would only
  be 9 fear in total. adding prussia would only add 1 town, and prussia 4 or
  higher would need 16 fear generated.
</p>

<p>
  so we should try to cause a ravage in east3. the disease is preventing that,
  but there's a way to remove it: thriving crops. it could build in east2 and
  east3 since they already have disease, and it could also add more invaders to
  destroy in east4.
</p>

<p>
  in that case, we want the fear card to be daunted by the dahan, so the dahan
  survive to deal damage in the counterattacks. that has the bonus of also
  generating 1 more fear.
</p>

<p>
  also, saltsburg ravages upgrade instead of cascade, which is a good thing
  since upgrading invaders means more fear for destroying them. however, it also
  means that the two ravages are only going to add 2 blight. prussia 6 can cause
  more, but none of the other lands besides east7 can be made a mining land
  easily, and east7 ravaging will mean that east8 builds.
</p>

<p>
  instead, we can use strong earth to add a blight that can actually cascade,
  and repeatedly cascade between east3 and east4, flipping thriving crops and
  then a blighted card like aid.
</p>

<p>
  now all we need is to deal 2 damage in east3 and destroy the town in east2 in
  the slow phase. we still need to reach terror 2, so we also count the fear
  generated:
  <br />
  4 from haunts and embers <br />
  1 from daunted by the dahan <br />
  4 from east4 (it starts with explorer explorer town, builds a city from
  thriving crops, then the town can be upgraded before it gets destroyed) <br />
  4 from east3 (it starts with explorer town city, then something is upgraded)
  <br />
  1 from the east2 town <br />
  for a total of 14. so destroying everything will just win against lower levels
  of prussia, and for higher levels, you just need to generate 2 extra fear
  while doing that.
</p>

<h1>section 3: the 3 relevant levels of prussia</h1>

<h3>low level prussia: prussia 1-3</h3>

<ul>
  <li>explore wetlands</li>
  <li>gain and play haunts and embers (plus maybe another card)</li>
  <li>
    haunts and embers pushes strifed town from east3 to east4, cascade to east4
    (4 fear total)
  </li>
  <li>
    daunted by the dahan generates 1 fear, invaders deal 6 less damage to dahan
    (5 fear total)
  </li>
  <li>build wetlands, start with east4</li>
  <li>flip strong earth, add blight to east3, cascade to east4</li>
  <li>
    flip thriving crops, build in east2 east3 east4, continue cascading to east3
    then either east2 or east7, whichever one doesn't have presence
  </li>
  <li>flip border</li>
  <li>
    east4 upgrades town before counterattack destroying both cities (9 fear
    total)
  </li>
  <li>
    east3 ravages, either upgrade town before counterattack dealing 2 damage to
    both cities, or upgrade explorer before counterattack destroying city and
    dealing 1 damage to a town
  </li>
  <li>ravage east3 flips aid</li>
</ul>

<p>
  to finish off low level prussia, you need to finish off east2 and east3. east2
  has a town, and east3 has either 2 cities that have taken 2 damage or 2 towns,
  one of which has taken 1 damage. destroying all of this will generate 14 fear
  in total, which is already enough to reach terror 2.
</p>

<h3>mid level prussia: prussia 4-5</h3>

<ul>
  <li>explore wetlands</li>
  <li>gain and play haunts and embers (plus maybe another card)</li>
  <li>
    haunts and embers pushes strifed town from east3 to east4, cascade to east4
    (4 fear total)
  </li>
  <li>
    daunted by the dahan generates 1 fear, invaders deal 6 less damage to dahan
    (5 fear total)
  </li>
  <li>build wetlands, start with east4</li>
  <li>flip strong earth, add blight to east3, cascade to east4</li>
  <li>
    flip thriving crops, build in east2 east3 east4, continue cascading to east3
    then either east2 or east7, whichever one doesn't have presence
  </li>
  <li>flip border</li>
  <li>
    east4 upgrades town before counterattack destroying both cities (9 fear
    total)
  </li>
  <li>
    east3 ravages, either upgrade town before counterattack dealing 2 damage to
    both cities, or upgrade explorer before counterattack destroying city and
    dealing 1 damage to a town
  </li>
  <li>ravage east3 flips aid</li>
</ul>

<p>
  to finish off mid level prussia, you need to finish off east2 and east3, plus
  generate 2 fear to reach terror 2, which is at 16 fear. you can get 1 out of
  the 2 fear from destroying a town that escalated.
</p>

<h3>high level prussia: prussia 6</h3>

<ul>
  <li>explore either swetlands or jwetlands</li>
  <li>gain and play haunts and embers (plus maybe another card)</li>
  <li>
    haunts and embers pushes strifed town from east3 to east4, cascade to east4
    (4 fear total)
  </li>
  <li>
    daunted by the dahan generates 1 fear, invaders deal 6 less damage to dahan
    (5 fear total)
  </li>
  <li>build swetlands or jwetlands, start with east4</li>
  <li>flip strong earth, add blight to east3, cascade to east4</li>
  <li>
    flip thriving crops, build in east2 east3 east4, continue cascading to east3
    then either east2 or east7, whichever one doesn't have presence
  </li>
  <li>flip border</li>
  <li>
    east4 upgrades town before counterattack destroying both cities (9 fear
    total)
  </li>
  <li>
    east3 ravages, either upgrade town before counterattack dealing 2 damage to
    both cities, or upgrade explorer before counterattack destroying city and
    dealing 1 damage to a town
  </li>
  <li>ravage east3 flips aid</li>
  <li>explore either coastal or something with prussia escalation</li>
</ul>

<p>
  to finish off high level prussia, you need to finish off east2 and east3, plus
  dealing with either east1 or east5 by preventing the build or destroying the
  town, plus generating 2 more fear to get to terror 2, some of which can come
  from dealing with east1 or east5.

  </ul>
  <p>
    there are plenty of damage minors with fire, but none deal 2 damage at range
    2, so you can't both use panda's innate for fear and clear the buildings
    from east3
  </p>

    <li>left innate replaces east2 town</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    swallowed generates 2 fear, but you lose a fear because you don't actually
    destroy the east2 town (and you can't hit your right innate to make up that
    1 fear while still being able to destroy east3 and reach east2). playing
    perils lets you hit your right innate, but perils itself only generates 1
    fear, so you still can't reach 16 fear.

  <p>
    this is a sacrifice victory. memory can't deal with both east2 and east3 but
    can threshold drought to take out the east3 city without the ravage
    happening.

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    mentor can reach east4 with a sacred site much more easily and can straight
    up defend the dahan in east3, so the fear card clears east2 instead of
    saving the east4 dahan.

  <p>
    unfortunately the minors that deal 2 damage while also generating fear don't
    work. sunsets fire is too expensive to repeat (flipping border would prevent
    downpour from having a sacred site), devouring and pull beneath can't deal 2
    damage in east3, and savage mawbeasts requires 3 animal.

    to deal the extra damage with infesting spores, we need to not use up both
