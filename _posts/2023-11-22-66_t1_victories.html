  there are 10 spirit/aspects that i know can defeat a double 6 on turn 1,
  increased from the 9 mentioned previously.

</p>

<p>
  this is a relatively normal tsac victory that plays a bunch of minors, but wwb
  has an extra energy and an extra presence, letting it drought 3 times
  <br />
  also the extra starting blight is very useful against cowsburg

  even base earth can do this, aspects only make it easier. gift of strength is
  the important thing, letting earth repeat drought without needing twinned days
  to be one of the 3 minors from tsac
