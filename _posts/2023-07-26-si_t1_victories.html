<h1>section 1: the original reddit post</h1>

<p>
  a year ago, someone made a
  <a
    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spiritisland/comments/utnfs2/puzzle_challenge_turn_1_true_solo_victory/"
    target="_blank"
  >
    reddit post</a
  >
  about winning on turn 1. there were several solutions found. there was one
  each with trickster, fractured, volcano, and snek. trickster, volcano, and
  snek all won against prussia 0, while the solution with fractured won against
  up to prussia 3. additionally, trickster and volcano won before the invader
  phase entirely, while fractured won during the invader phase using fear cards.
  snek took until the slow phase to win. the distinction between these was quite
  interesting, and i found the solutions that won before the invader actions
  generally more interesting. the solution with volcano has stopped working,
  because it uses a retired card, but all other solutions still work.
</p>

<h1>section 2: the skies herald challenge</h1>

<p>
  fast forward 6 months to when nature incarnate was being previewed on
  backerkit, somebody named jonathan found a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXQaoimEEac" target="_blank">
    way to win on turn 1</a
  >. it was apparently unconstrained enough that he had to add an additional
  constraint of using skies herald. this did take the entirety of turn 1,
  including the slow phase, however. it used ember-eyed behemoth and
  transformative sacrifice (which i will refer to as tsac), both of which were
  announced in the preview.
</p>
<p>
  a bit later, someone in the si discord came up with a way to win with might
  earth, also using tsac and following the confines of using skies herald. this
  is even less constrained, since it won without actually resolving skies
  herald, and it also won before the invader actions. that way didn't use a
  spirit from ni, but it used one of the newly announced blight cards, shattered
  fragments of power. this solution no longer works after nature incarnate
  delivery, since shattered fragments of power was nerfed from 3 energy to 2
  between the reveal and the delivery. however, since skies herald wasn't really
  used here, it could be replaced by something that grants energy with similar
  elements like gift of living energy, which would make up for the lost energy
  from the blight card.
</p>
<p>
  it turns out that nature incarnate just has a bunch of cards that are amazing
  for early wins. this probably came at a cost of them being weaker as yolo
  majors.
</p>

<h1>section 3: exaltation of the incandescent sky</h1>

<p>
  fast forward another 6 months, when another cool major was revealed in a
  <a
    href="https://archives.mitmh2023.com/2023/abcde.puzzlefactory.place/puzzles/dahan-konundrum"
  >
    very cool fashion</a
  >. the card itself did a lot of supportive things, including granting an extra
  card play and two slow-to-fasts, or twice that in true solo. i felt like this
  card may be useful for causing some early wins.
</p>
<p>
  since i was far more familiar with exaltation than most others were, i decided
  to try doing things with it. i tried getting fractured to win with it on turn
  1, though it was pretty hard without any of fractured's other cards being
  affordable. fractured would be 1 energy short of being able to win on turn 1.
</p>
<p>
  so the next spirit i turned to was bringer. a good perk about bringer is that
  they have a way to gain and play a major on turn 1 without needing to have
  enough energy to play it at the start of the turn. however, it still needed to
  actually pay the energy to play the card, so i would need to figure out how to
  gain the 7 energy in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  enter the infinite loop. the most updated version is powerstorm, unlock, and
  most importantly, unleash. unleash was how this infinite loop ended up being
  energy positive. <br />
  with unleash, bringer could gain 8 extra energy at the beginning of the turn,
  and then call could be used to gain and play exaltation.
</p>
<p>
  the general plan would be to start with call and unleash, forget unleash for
  energy, use call to gain and play exaltation, then use exaltation to play
  dreams and predatory nightmares, making predatory nightmares fast. optimally,
  this would generate 10 fear from exaltation, 2 from predatory, 2 from night
  terrors, and 3 from dreams, for a total of 17. however, the only way to get
  the 10 fear from exaltation is to destroy 2 cities. the only board where
  bringer can get 2 cities into its lands with a range 1 presence placement is
  board g against scotland, but then there would be no dahan among bringer's
  lands to let bringer gain call on midnight's dream. so the best is actually 14
  fear, by exaltation destroying a city and a town. however, only one adversary
  would make this possible with the dahan positioned to let bringer gain the
  major with call, and that didn't mess with the damage in a different way, like
  england does with its extra health.
</p>
<p>
  fortunately, saltsburg was accidentally entirely revealed in the unboxing
  video. its setup added a city in the inland land that already had the town, so
  if bringer could get a presence in that land, it could get the 7 fear from
  exaltation. also fortunately, on boards d and f, that's the land that bringer
  starts in. additionally, on board d, that land also starts with 2 dahan.
</p>
<p>
  so it was fairly easy to achieve terror 2 against saltsburg 2. hell, it's even
  possible against saltsburg 6, since its terror 1 has only 4 cards. we just
  need to somehow gain 2 more fear using tl1 fear cards. and that's pretty easy
  to do with dahan reclaim fishing grounds, especially since i'd already need 3
  dahan in d2 for maxing dreams of the dahan.

<h1>section 4: violence</h1>

<p>
  nature incarnate finally arrived at the end of june. with that came a lot of
  content, the most notable being bringer's violence aspect. it started with an
  extra energy, doubled card plays, and earned more fear.
</p>
<p>
  i wondered how much violence could do on turn 1. i started with the turn 1 win
  of base bringer against saltsburg 6, and looked at how that win would play out
  with violence.
</p>
<p>
  violence would generate 1-2 more fear from exaltation depending on the initial
  explore, 1 more from predatory nightmares, and 2 more from having bats scout
  instead of dreams. i could also play bats scout without exaltation, which lets
  the right innate gain 1 more fear. that would be 5-6 more fear in the fast
  phase, which could total 20 fear. that would be enough to take down a double
  adversary! i'd just need to figure out how to get rid of some extra buildings
  with the fear cards, which is pretty easy since we could easily have 1 fear
  card deal with each building. i will demonstrate this combo with saltsburg +
  france, that and saltsburg + prussia are the two simplest double 6s to
  demonstrate.
</p>

</div>
<p>
  this, possibly with slightly modified kicking destinations and fear cards,
  work with most combos of saltsburg, france, prussia, and russia. the combos
  involving russia need some setup to earn fear from russia 2 kicking explorers,
  as russia starts with 5 fear cards at tl1.
</p>

<h1>section 5: tl4 on turn 1!?</h1>

<p>
  violence starting with a free energy also has the extra bonus of being able to
  play tsac turn 1, so i started thinking about what i could do with tsac and
  call as the two initial card plays.
</p>
<p>
  first, i wanted to get as much energy as i could with that use of call. so the
  2 minors i got with tsac would both be to move dahan together, and i needed 2
  minors because one minor could only move 3 dahan at a time. however, 6 energy
  from one use of call wasn't enough to play exaltation.
</p>
<p>
  instead, i could do it using unlock the gates, which would also be an
  automatic threshold. tsac already had plenty of elements that bringer doesn't
  use, so all i needed to threshold unlock were sun, earth, and animal. promises
  of protection has all 3 of those elements and gathers dahan, which was
  perfect. however, i also remembered that skies herald existed by thinking
  about jonathan's challenge earlier, and it also gathered dahan, and had sun
  and animal. i eventually decided on using rites of the land's rejection
  instead of promises, because rites is 1-cost, and wouldn't interfere with as
  much if i wanted to play twinned days later, and all i needed besides skies
  herald was earth.
</p>
<p>
  now that i have a way to threshold unlock the gates, i thought about if i
  could extend this combo even further, as i would only have 2 extra energy by
  this point which isn't enough to play both predatory nightmares and bats
  scout. i remembered that the threshold of solidify echoes existed, which would
  let me re-gain call and play it again.
</p>
<p>
  with the second use of call, i could gain 6 more energy, and another major. i
  figured that a good major to play with this would be powerstorm, as it would
  be thresholded and let me repeat the 3 majors i already had in play.
</p>
<p>
  so with the 8 energy that i'd have, it would probably be best to repeat tsac,
  then solidify, then unlock, as tsac gives destroyed presence for solidify to
  return, and solidify gains energy so it can't really be played last. 8 energy
  isn't quite enough to play all of these, but if tsac gives an energy-gaining
  minor, i could use it on myself to afford unlock. then unlock could give me
  exaltation for free, and i am still allowed to forget a card with unlock so i
  can forget that minor if it's a zero-cost. if i also get twinned days, i could
  repeat the energy-giving minor and give myself 4 extra energy, which would be
  enough for me to play a 4-cost major with call, and then exaltation could play
  both of the cards still in my hand.
</p>
<p>
  so now that i had the setup done, i started looking at how this would actually
  defeat adversaries. i noticed immediately that melt earth would be able to
  double the fear i generate from towns and explorers, so that was obviously the
  major to take with the third call. i also looked into some minors that would
  be good, and some of the best minors turned out to be scour, drought, and
  twinned days. it took me a while to notice that scour required a sacred site
  to use, and that twinned days cost energy, so i dealt with those by having
  tsac sac fewer presence so i could use scour, and not playing predatory so i
  could repeat 1-cost cards with twinned days.
</p>
<p>
  drought and scour also add blight, and depending on how i handle things, i
  could also end up flipping the blight card and getting aid from lesser spirits
  for another power card that i can use, though that isn't always necessary.
</p>
<p>
  this combo is fairly easy to demonstrate with sweden plus a non-cowsburg
  adversary, so i'll demonstrate against scotland with the thicc fear deck.

    before any fear is generated, you're already playing 6 majors. the board

  <ul>
    <li>melt earth d7 kicks a town to d5 and a town to d1 (7 fear total)</li>
    <li>
      exaltation plays bats scout and deals 3 damage in d5 and 3 damage in d8,
      kicking it to d7 where melt earth kicks everything to d1, and generates 5
      fear (2 energy left, +21=28 fear total)
    </li>
    <li>
      drought in d1 kicks the 3 towns to d7, then melt earth kicks everything
      back to d1 (+18=46 fear total)
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
      twinned bats scout in d1 kicks the 3 towns to d7, then melt earth kicks
      everything back to d1 (1 energy left, +18=82 fear total)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    scotland and sweden only have 20 fear cards when combined, which only needs
    80 fear total. so this is already a victory at tl4!
  </p>

</div>

<h1>section 6: thematic boards</h1>

<p>
  so a bad thing about using the balanced side is that it only has 6 dahan. the
  thematic boards have a lot more. on northeast and east boards, it's pretty
  easy to get 7 dahan into one land with the 2 minors from tsac. this means i
  can get more energy with call, which means more flexibility with majors.
</p>
<p>
  also, i found a way to play 1 more major, instead of predatory and bats scout,
  which would usually be better since i can probably find a major that works
  better than both of those combined. i settled on sweep into the sea as a
  pretty good one, especially when comboed with melt earth.
</p>
<p>
  to make it work, i would gain entwined instead of melt earth, and use entwined
  to gain 2 majors, one of which is melt earth. this would also gain 4 more
  energy than how i had it previously, which would make it so that i didn't need
  to gain nature's connection and could play 2 distinct destructive minors plus
  twinned days with tsac. i would even have 2 spare energy at the end to pay for
  both of the repeats from twinned days.
</p>
<p>
  so by this point i've worked through all the building-heavy combos by
  repeatedly droughting into the melted land. except for one pair: england
  cowsburg. for the longest time, i thought melt earth didn't work into this
  combo (it apparently works normally if the melt earth land is blighted), so i
  looked for a solution without it. scour didn't work nearly as well against
  this adversary pair either, since if it is used in an unblighted land, it
  would only have enough damage to destroy 2 towns. drought was unaffected
  because of the 1 damage to each building. so i decided to not use scour, and
  that freed up a minor for an energy-gaining minor, which let me play a 6-cost
  instead of melt earth. i settled on rumbling earthquakes, since that
  completely ignores the health bonuses from both adversaries.
</p>
<p>
  since rumbling earthquakes needs a sacred site, i chose unnatural prolif as
  the blight card, especially since it also adds cities for rumbling earthquakes
  to target. also, to make even more invaders for sweep to destroy, i put
  thriving crops as a still-healthy island before unnatural prolif, and did some
  extra blight cascading.

  </ul>
  <p>
    the board before sweep looks something like this, though in this picture i
    kicked a town from east2 to east4 instead of east4 to east2:
  </p>
  <img src="/assets/img/cowsburg_england6b.jpg" />
  <p>
    cowsburg 6 + england 6 have a total of 18 fear cards combined, which is only
    90 fear, so this is already a victory at tl4!
  </p>
</div>

<h1>section 7, all together now</h1>
<p>
  using the combined sweep + melt earth strategy, i can actually generate enough
  fear to take out all adversaries at level 6 together!
</p>
<p>
  the fear deck is pretty thicc. it's 15/19/12 which is a total of 46 fear
  cards, which makes 230 fear to burn through.
</p>
<p>
  because of england lc, the most fear i can generate is around 240, if england
  lc is removed it's possible to generate upwards of 300 fear by adding thriving
  crops.
</p>
<p>
  to place the escalation buildings where i want them to be, i will force
  scotland to escalate after prussia, france, and cowsburg, since scotland can
  add towns in lands with towns, while the other escalations can't. england
  escalation is forced to be in lands 2 or 3, since they each start with 4
  buildings.
</p>
<p>
  if i have prussia's deck changes after scotland, the stage 3 card will be
  first, which is better because i want mountains and wetlands to be the initial
  explore for maximum fear generation.

      left)
    </li>
    <li>
      thresholded entwined power gains melt earth and sweep, forgetting bats
      scout and predatory, and gains 6 energy (14 energy left)
    </li>
    <li>powerstorm repeats unlock (10 energy left)</li>
    <li>thresholded unlock gains and plays exaltation</li>
    <li>
      exaltation kicks 3 explorers from east9 and east8 into east4, and plays
      melt earth and sweep (2 energy left, 11 fear total)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    now that all the cards have been played, the board looks like this: (still
    without the high immigration tile. i also forgot to forget bats scout)
  </p>
  <img src="/assets/img/aadva.jpg" />
  <ul>
    <li>melt earth in east3 kicks both towns into east4 (+7=18 fear total)</li>
    <li>
      drought in east2 kicks 3 towns into east3, melt earth kicks them back into
      east2 (+23=41 fear total)
    </li>
    <li>
      twinned drought in east2 kicks 3 towns into east3, melt earth kicks them
      back into east2 (1 energy left, 64 fear total)
    </li>
    <li>
      unnatural prolif adds a presence in east9 and adds a dahan and 2 cities in
      east10
    </li>
    <li>
      scour kicks all 3 explorers and 2 towns from east7 into east3, melt earth
      kicks a town into east2 and everything else into east4 (+18=82 fear total)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    now we're ready to use sweep into the sea. (the fear count is slightly off
    in this picture, there should be 6 less fear generated)
  </p>
  <img src="/assets/img/aadvb.jpg" />
  <ul>
    <li>
      sweep into the sea pushes all 12 explorers and 5 towns from east4 into
      east3, melt earth kicks it all into east2 (+27=109 fear total)
    </li>
    <li>
      this doesn't hit england lc because it's in the middle of an action tree
      (sweep threshold repeat is a triggered action), and losses are checked at
      the end of action trees
    </li>
    <li>
      sweep into the sea kicks everything from east2 into east3, melt earth
      kicks all 15 explorers into east4, and evenly distributes the 9 towns
      among east2, east4, and east7 (+84=193 fear total)
    </li>
    <li>
      twinned scour in east4 kicks 2 towns and all 15 explorers into east3,
      east3 kicks them back to east4 (+42=235 fear total)
    </li>
  </ul>
