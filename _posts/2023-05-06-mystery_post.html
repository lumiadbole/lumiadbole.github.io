title: mystery hunt write-up
---

<p>
  this is an extremely late write-up, but given the information that i reveal in
  this post, it couldn't really come earlier
</p>

<h1>intro</h1>

<p>
  so let's start from the very beginning. in january, the night before mystery
  hunt 2022.
</p>
<p>
  i was originally considering walking over from et and sleeping at teammate's
  airbnb the night before. that was my original plan, but it changed for a
  couple reasons: first, my covid pcr test from wednesday didn't have results
  out until late wednesday night, and second, i ended up deeming it too
  dangerous to walk a route i was unfamiliar with at night.
</p>
<p>
  so i slept at et that thursday night. it was my very first time sleeping over
  at et. <br />there were a couple other things about et that were interesting,
  one of which was a thing i wrote on the whiteboard about the amount of time
  before hunt starting, which i would be constantly updating. the other
  interesting thing was that et also had its own mystery hunt team. it is quite
  amusing that i have close ties to two mystery hunt teams for location-related
  reasons, but i don't hunt with either of those teams since i was pushed onto
  teammate my freshman year by cj and just stayed there.
</p>
<p>
  friday morning, i walked from et to teammate's airbnb, arriving at around 11.
  i recognized approximately 1 person, though everyone there was definitely very
  friendly. we were playing just two to pass the last hour before kickoff, then
  i jokingly mentioned that spirit island would be a bad idea, and was happy
  that several teammates have also played it a lot, though probably not as much
  as i have. at that point i think i've spent around 100 hours playing spirit
  island, though i also don't remember how quickly i was adding to that around
  that time. the semesters surrounding it i spent at least 4 hours a week,
  though it could have been as high as 10 hours on some weeks.
</p>
<!-- v_enhance -->
<p>
  anyways, we started doing puzzles, after being entertained by 3 countdowns in
  a row. i contributed a decent amount during hunt, going mostly for logic
  puzzles and solving them very quickly. i was told i was the strongest logic
  puzzler out of everybody at that airbnb, and probably top 3 in teammate
  overall, which definitely strongly boosted my self-esteem. sadly, i failed to
  be completely pacifist in hunt, as i remember very clearly accidentally
  killing a captain in one of the sci-fi-cisco puzzles.
</p>
<p>
  we ended up finding the coin sometime sunday morning. i was very excited for
  this, as i was the one person on teammate who was also in mit puzzle club, so
  i could do a lot of things.
</p>
<p>
  i left the airbnb on monday afternoon carrying way too much stuff with me, and
  spent like 1.5 hours walking to next because et wasn't planning to drive a van
  to campus until i passed them and crossed the charles river. when i got to
  next, i decided to visit wayne, whom i can probably reveal that i was kinda
  crushing on at that time. the "cluedump" (a thing from esp that was named
  after a thing from sipb) happened later that afternoon, though i and wayne did
  end up doing some silly shenanigans with one of the puzzles (specifically
  <a>https://puzzles.mit.edu/2022/puzzle/how-to-make-the-right-move/</a>, wayne
  made a mouse slip while doing #9 and dragged the king to h1 instead of g1)
</p>
<p>
  that cluedump went nicely, it made me excited, though i didn't really have any
  puzzle ideas or know what to do in the later days. i was hoping that i would
  be able to write some puzzles though…
</p>
<p>
  not only was i excited for writing puzzles, i was also excited about having a
  unique role in mystery hunt organization this year. specifically, i was the
  only mit undergrad on teammate, and i was also part of puzzle club exec. i
  knew i would have to do some logistics work, though i wasn't quite informed
  about how much or what nature the work would be. hopefully it would be enough
  to make me feel important, but not enough to overwhelm me…
</p>
<h1>spring semester</h1>
<p>
  a couple weeks after the cluedump, patrick reached out to me asking if i
  wanted to write a puzzle with him. i was very enthusiastic about this, and
  after hearing his ideas, i spent 4 hours that night outlining what would
  happen in the puzzle. patrick eventually wrote the actual script for the
  puzzle, and with some checking of work, we had a testsolvable draft. this
  puzzle got shared at a "puzzle potluck" kind of event, but it ended up being
  pretty underclued once we tried it out, and i decided to put this puzzle on
  pause for a bit.
</p>
<p>
  this semester, i decided to take the squares class. this isn't actually
  connected to hunt in any way, it's just to make people reading this think
  there is a puzzle about square dancing. i did think of a few ideas for how to
  make a puzzle about square dancing, but those ideas didn't come until the end
  of 2022, since for most of 2022 i was busy learning calls. i went from nothing
  in january 2022 to knowing basically all of c2 in january 2023.
</p>
<p>
  a couple other hunt-related events happened around this time in the year.
  first of all, theme proposals and voting happened. as other teammates have
  mentioned, they were basically all "teammate is evil". i really liked the
  aesthetics of one proposed theme and the mechanics of a different one, but
  those themes ended up being the least popular ones, and i guess they would
  have also been a lot harder to work on, so it worked out better in the end.
</p>
<p>
  second, there was a small event where we speedwrote metapuzzles in small
  groups, where we were given a type of food and how the meta we wrote should
  use that type of food. the first group i worked in just misunderstood the
  instructions, and the first puzzle had the food used in the shell instead of
  as one of the answers. i also ended up committing learned helplessness for the
  other rounds and really didn't get the mindset to do much for the other 2
  rounds.
</p>
<p>
  third, the potluck thing happened. i don't remember a lot about it, except
  that it was during one of the days of spring hssp (an esp program), so i just
  stayed in the room afterwards to look at the puzzles. i remember wslp and
  redacted recipes existing here, but nothing really else. the puzzle i was
  invited to co-write was also shared here, though no teams made significant
  progress on it. i would eventually re-write this into a different puzzle
  throughout the rest of the year, but that's another story that i'll save for
  later.
</p>
<p>
  anyways, skip forwards to may, the day of east side festival (a yearly
  festival held at ec). i would have been getting my hair re-dyed that day,
  except that all the hair dye disappeared for some reason, so i didn't have
  anything concrete to do at the festival. fortunately, teammate also had a
  bunch of people nearby, and i was able to talk to people and get a couple of
  puzzle ideas, though none of them really came to fruition. i did actually end
  up with an entire puzzle draft, though i don't think it was really that
  interesting, and i didn't get the motivation to continue working on any of
  them before the answers became unclaimed.
</p>
<p>
  i also signed up to edit puzzles over the summer, but i failed to get assigned
  to anything over the summer, which was maybe a fault in my own communication.
  the next time i was asked about editing, summer had already passed and i
  started becoming hosed again, so i was no longer able to edit.
</p>
<h1>summer</h1>

<p>
  unfortunately, for all of summer, i was not nearly as helpful as i wanted, and
  i did not make nearly as much progress on puzzle-writing as i wanted, since i
  accidentally got addicted to two minecraft modpacks: vault hunters, and
  enigmatica 2: expert skyblock.
</p>
<p>
  i was involved in plenty of testsolving and writing that happened over the
  summer, but i spent nowhere near as much time on either as i did on minecraft.
  <br />i don't really remember what i testsolved over the summer, but i also
  lived at et where a couple of current members of et (including two that i
  talked to basically constantly) still lived over the summer. this kinda meant
  that i wasn't really able to work on puzzles, since i needed to make sure they
  didn't see or hear about any of the stuff i worked on.
</p>
<!-- tckmn, redstonerodent-->
<p>
  i do remember getting pulled into another puzzle since patrick asked me if i
  wanted to help write a logic puzzle for what eventually became
  <a
    src="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/puzzlefactory.place/puzzles/book-of-fixed-stars"
    >book of fixed stars</a
  >. i said sure, though unfortunately i was also really bad and unconfident at
  writing logic puzzles so i wasn't really ready for it. it wouldn't really get
  worked on for a while, as there was stuff to be done before the logic part got
  written, and we would also need to plan out how to make the regions exist.
  later in the year (in october), i thought of doing a reverse star battle,
  though this would have been very unconstrained, and i also didn't like star
  battle so i should maybe have thought harder about alternatives. fortunately,
  the lead author, mona, later had the idea of using tentaisho, which was much
  better since it was region division, though it's also not a puzzle type i was
  good at either writing or solving.
</p>
<p>
  i ended up getting bailed out of this puzzle by justin yokota, who used a
  program to find a solvable tentaisho-moonsun combo. my major contribution
  ended up being verifying that this puzzle was solvable by hand, though i
  somehow ruled out one of the three solutions to the standalone tentaisho,
  which fortunately didn't end up mattering.
</p>
<p>
  i also remember volunteering to help olga write crossword clues for endless
  knots. i also joined a group to testsolve the rest of the puzzle, but i myself
  didn't get anywhere, and the puzzle ended up getting completely rewritten.
</p>
<p>
  galactic asked a bunch of us to help testsolve gph near the end of the summer.
  i was pretty excited for this, but this made me miss the practice session for
  tech squares amateur night, which i was partially planning though not very
  prepared to call for, so i ended up deciding not to call at all. that makes
  this the second year in a row that gph had really annoying timing, though i
  don't think it's anybody's fault, it's probably just bad luck. anyways, after
  doing the intro round which i kinda enjoyed, i looked at the main round. this
  was a previously untested gimmick with new mechanics, but the main issue i had
  was that re-entering the answers would refresh the page and lock the puzzle
  for everyone, so i couldn't go back to look at the puzzles when i was working
  on them. fortunately this got changed later, but it was a mechanic that i
  really didn't like. this, combined with my ongoing minecraft addiction, the
  fact that i suck at making insights in hunt puzzles and the fact that i was
  still living at et where other people i sit next to would want to do gph
  later, meant that i didn't end up doing anything for the entire rest of the
  testsolve. <br />however, i did contribute enough to be acknowledged on the
  gph wrapup page, so someone from galactic who didn't know me asked me for my
  name. this was right after i started going by lumia, which is a name i
  imported indirectly from my minecraft username. however, i also wanted to
  change my last name, so i decided to ask the group i talked to while deciding
  a minecraft username for a suggestion for my last name, since they basically
  already chose my first name. someone suggested a word from puflantu, so i
  looked through the dictionaries and found a couple that could work. i ended up
  being torn between neyo (which means 180) and adbole (which meant star), i
  ended up choosing neyo since it would make my name euryvocalic, though i also
  realized in february 2023 that i could also make adbole work since my name
  would be supervocalic if i dropped the a from my first name.
</p>
<!-- chrisjones -->
<p>
  apparently teammate had a retreat somewhere sometime in august, but i didn't
  go because i didn't want to spend money. i think there was stuff happening
  virtually, but i don't think i actually participated in any of that at all.
</p>
<h1>fall semester</h1>

<p>
  now we've entered the fall semester. i was initially taking 4 classes this
  semester, but one of them ended up being too hard and also conflicting with a
  second-semester class that i registered for, so i ended up taking 3.5 classes.
  out of those 3 full-semester classes, 18.217 (young tableaux) was very lenient
  on assignments (there were two over the entire semester), 18.821 (project lab,
  i.e. simulated research) was a group project class, and 18.404
  (computability/complexity theory) was very fun though pretty difficult. so i
  did still have plenty of time for testsolving during the semester.
</p>
<p>
  when the semester started, meetings between teammate and puzzle club resumed.
  i volunteered to be the person handling all the "normal" classrooms and
  filling out all the forms, as well as being the person deciding where events
  will be. these could really only be done by me, since i'm the one person who's
  both on teammate (so i could get spoiled on events) and on puzzle club exec
  (so i could coordinate room stuff with the rest of puzzle club exec). walker
  and moor carried me through a lot of this by writing all the emails that i
  needed to send. walker was also in my group in 18.821 so i could talk to them
  pretty often.
</p>
<p>
  during the semester, we finally made our announcement for the registration
  website going up. i volunteered to be the one telling the puzzle discord
  servers about this, though unfortunately none of the mods of one of the
  servers that i asked (i think i only asked the mods who were active (i.e.
  green or red on discord) at that time) responded until after the announcement
  went up in puzzle world. the funny part is, cmu puzzlehunt was announced in
  that server like 1 minute before mystery hunt was announced, so there was
  plenty of banter about the announcement timing.
</p>
<p>
  i also got to eavesdrop on teams planning what they were gonna do for mystery
  hunt, as well as joining the discord servers of some of the teams i was
  closest to, such as random, wafflehaus, and et phone in answer. et phone in
  answer gave everybody the ability to manage channels, which will be important
  later.
</p>
<h2>testsolving</h2>

<p>
  i don't think any of the testsolving was that remarkable, since i got carried
  through a majority of the puzzles. one puzzle i do remember testsolving was
  reflective screen, which i did solo from around midnight to around 4am. i got
  the aha for the logic puzzles basically instantly, and also the extraction
  pretty quickly, but i failed to realize the answer was the answer. i had the
  answer actually written out in the spreadsheet when i said "i'm gonna go to
  sleep", which resulted in this interaction:
</p>

<img src="/assets/img/isuckatextraction.png" />

<p>
  another puzzle i remember testsolving was a trip to the museum. i was told to
  take pictures of what i thought would be part of the puzzle (after i was given
  the puzzle), but i also spent an extra 3 hours at the museum being at the
  museum and looking at stuff. there was one particularly interesting video
  showcasing something that's mildly sexual so i should probably not share it
  here. actually, this is my website, so i'll just say that it was about making
  female semen and there was extensive discussion of sex and gender,
  particularly the meaning of sex that is not compared to gender.
</p>
<p>
  i saw a lot of other things at the museum, specifically the stuff on the third
  floor which was not part of the puzzle. that was where the robot and ai stuff
  was, as opposed to the stuff on the second floor which was mostly biology and
  astronomy. there was that exhibit that was building a sandwich while a robot
  is pouring drinks around you. the name of the exhibit was something like "be a
  good robot teammate" and of course i participated in that.
</p>
<h2>that one puzzle i wrote that actually made it into hunt</h2>
<p>
  specifically
  <a href="https://puzzlefactory.place/puzzles/set-off-fireworks">this one</a>
</p>
<p>
  sometime in december, we were having a weekend where we blitz-wrote puzzles
  for conjuri. i was having a conversation with evan, and he said a couple of
  things about hanabi, as well as making a remark about a hanabi word puzzle. he
  also wanted help writing crossword clues for diagramless, so i volunteered to
  help him do that as well.
</p>
<p>
  i thought about evan's remark overnight, and then came up with a
  hanabi-scrabble hybrid puzzle. the first draft of this was way too cheesable,
  since the answer phrase would have been read directly from the hands of two
  players at the end, which meant that the other two players' hands didn't
  really matter, and you'd know what to focus on by reading through the puzzle
  at the start.
</p>
<p>
  i rewrote this puzzle twice. the first rewrite was to make the discarded tiles
  matter, and the second rewrite was because i realized that i was playing cards
  from the wrong side of the hand. the extraction for the puzzle also changed,
  from reading the word directly, to a cluephrase involving multiplication and
  time (which was the definition used in the meta), to its current version with
  two cluephrases of "previously owned" and "learned from others".
</p>
<p>
  the process of choosing what letters went where and what clues were given was
  pretty tedious because there were very few constraints, so i added a
  constraint while writing that "yurt" appeared somewhere in the puzzle, since
  it would appear fairly early in the process, as the letters were chosen
  backwards. the choices of cluephrase were also pretty constrained, since i
  wanted to make the letters used in the game a subset of scrabble tiles, and
  the played letters just had to be in alphabetical order, so no x's or z's
  could be used, and only 1 f could be used, for example. i also went in after
  the last construction to make sure that the hints worked the same way as they
  did in normal hanabi, starting at 8 and not going below 0, and increasing by 1
  for every discard. this did throw off some of my planning, so at some points
  it was far harder to make words out of the letters of someone else's hand, but
  i still covered it mostly.
</p>
<p>
  i am still amused by the fact that such a large proportion of teammate plays
  hanabi, but i don't, yet i was the one writing a puzzle about it.
</p>
<h1>winter break</h1>

<p>
  anyways, the semester ended, and i went back home for a couple weeks. i didn't
  really want to go back home, but there was actually a pretty big benefit to
  being home compared to living on floorpi: i could talk about puzzles out loud.
  i couldn't do this on floorpi because cj is my next door neighbor and the
  walls are not very soundproof. i took advantage of this as much as i could by
  doing most of the changes to my puzzles, as well as both rewrites of set off
  fireworks there.
</p>
<p>
  this time was also around when the big hunt events started happening. there
  were a few speedruns of the full hunt, a showcase of hunt structure, a
  showcase of runaround, and so on. i tried to participate in as much of these
  as i could, though due to family reasons there definitely were things i
  couldn't do. there were a couple of final logistics things happening as well,
  such as me ordering things from mit's slightly modified amazon so that wayne,
  puzzle club's treasurer, doesn't have to see what's getting bought and get
  spoiled.
</p>
<h1>the final stretch</h1>

<p>
  so much stuff happened right after i got back onto campus the week before
  mystery hunt
</p>
<p>
  in the week leading up to hunt, i ended up skipping all classes to work on
  hunt. i walked the 20 minutes to teammate's airbnb several times to work
  there, and more importantly, to socialize and meet other teammates that i
  either haven't seen for a year (well, for 7 months for some of them) or have
  never met in person. i also spent some time admiring the puzzles and the art
  in the hunt. conjuri was my second favorite round, partially because it was
  the round that set off fireworks was in. admiral bootes was definitely my
  favorite by far, especially the dark theme, the fonts, and the puzzles
  themselves. i thought to myself that if anything was making me a catgirl, it
  would be this round. (though i do think one of my friends softened me up to
  this idea by a lot in the previous semester) i'll also make this paragraph an
  invitation for people who know me either online or irl to try to push me
  further in that direction.
</p>
<p>
  there were a lot of other non-puzzle things i still needed to do. there were
  meetings with custodial services, with e33 lighting, with mit video
  productions, and so on. i know that these organizations were all different,
  but the forms i filled out, and the emails i sent were so similar and so close
  together that they blurred together in my mind and made me unable to
  distinguish between them nearly as easily. it took until nearly the day of
  hunt for me to fully understand how many organizations i had interacted with:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    for the event registration, i had to fill out a form on atlas. it wasn't too
    bad since i've used the form before for a different organization, though as
    forms normally are, there are questions that i had to ask the rest of puzzle
    club about.
  </li>
  <li>
    for the room reservations, i decided to be the main point of contact for the
    main group of classrooms and for the bush room, and we would get asked about
    what rooms we needed, and of course we wanted as many of them as we could
    get. there were also some departmental rooms that walker emailed the
    department heads to request, and we then had to schedule key pickups and
    dropoffs for some of them, or to get the door codes for others.
  </li>
  <li>
    for the bush room, i had to fill out forms about reservations, timing, and
    capacity, and then figure out who all the mit students on teammate were so
    we could give all of them tap access. unfortunately, we couldn't give alums
    tap access, so one of the 3 mit students on teammate (either me, evan, or
    jake) had to be awake to let all of teammate in when campus opened up at
    7am.
  </li>
  <li>
    for the shirt designs, i had an email chain with student merch, which was to
    ask about whether we were using the trademark properly.
  </li>
  <li>
    for custodial services, i filled out a form, and then at some point met with
    the custodial staff to decide on what custodial services we wanted over the
    weekend. i ended up negotiating down what they would do to only picking up
    the trash that was left outside the classrooms overnight and not doing
    anything inside the rooms until after hunt ended, though i suspect that even
    that was unnecessary and we could have requested for them not to do that.
  </li>
  <li>
    for e33 lighting services, i uhh actually didn't interact with them that
    much to really understand what they were doing for us until the sunday of
    hunt. i do remember having some back-and-forth emails about not knowing how
    much to budget.
  </li>
  <li>
    for mit a/v, i again filled out some forms, and we picked up the equipment
    on friday morning just before hunt started.
  </li>
  <li>
    finally, for mit video productions, i filled out yet another form, and then
    had a meeting with them to decide on what exactly we needed from them. this
    meeting was slightly amusing because when i walked to teammate airbnb just
    before it, we were doing an icebreaker where we had to say something
    uninteresting about ourselves. ksun's uninteresting fact of having two
    windows open right next to each other on his laptop was definitely the best
    uninteresting fact, but i got to say that i had to go to a meeting as my
    uninteresting fact, which also let me escape the icebreaker with style.
    then, during the meeting, i called one of my teammates (alex) for
    assistance, who then said that he didn't have the authority to decide on
    this and called a different teammate (jacqui) over. i was told by moor that
    alex was the one who had opinions, though maybe jacqui just knew more about
    what should be done?
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  there was also stuff with our storage spaces in the basement of walker
  memorial that we lost last year, but we still had stuff in that space that we
  needed to use for hunt, such as phones and office supplies.
</p>
<p>
  of course, we also had several interactions, many of which nonpositive, with
  other organizations, though i won't reveal any details of the interactions
  here.
</p>
<p>
  the entire month before hunt was absolute hell for logistics, where it felt
  like basically all the forces of mit were against hunt happening. the
  announcement of stata being shut down on saturday (which i think was a bit
  older and we planned around), the bush room being occupied by a different
  group until 6pm on friday (which was also older and we planned around), then
  the internet not working, classes taking over our classrooms completely
  unnecessarily (i.e. one small class that cj was apparently in was moved from
  one room to a bigger room that we've already booked for being a hunt hq, for
  god knows whatever reason). campus being closed from 1-7am was also a mild
  annoyance for both teammate and the solvers, though that was at least better
  than all of fall semester, when campus was closed all the time and all doors
  needed tap access. logistics feels like it always is a nightmare though. one
  reason i suspect causing this is that a lot of mit administrative stuff only
  goes 2-3 months in advance, so e.g. for the event registration, the custodial
  services requests, and some of the room reservations, we needed to wait until
  november to do it. fortunately, some of the room reservations could be done
  earlier (thanks kaitlin and judith), but it was still annoying not being able
  to get the logistics stuff out of the way earlier.
</p>
<p>
  yet somehow, my sleep schedule that week was better than my sleep schedule for
  all of 2022. i went to sleep before midnight every night, since i was tired
  enough, and i also had to wake up early sometimes. i also still had time and
  energy to go to squares, and this time there were several mit alumni that were
  here for hunt. i forgot my squares nametag (i'm pretty sure i straight up just
  lost it), so i took a sticker and wrote bootes on it as my nametag. i knew i'd
  get away with this, since 1. it's a constellation 2. my friends all know i'm
  into starlight 3. specifically, it's a constellation in my favorite minecraft
  mod, astral sorcery 4. i've written not-my-name on my nametag a few times,
  though this action was inspired by someone else who wrote not-their-name on
  their nametags more consistently. though i did also draw the constellation on
  the sticker just in case, and i pronounced the name like the constellation and
  not the admiral when i was talking about it at squares. after hunt, someone
  said to me that they couldn't believe i got away with writing bootes on my
  nametag that night. i still feel pretty good about it.
</p>

<h1>pre-hunt prep</h1>

<p>
  the thursday before hunt, we went into a classroom and basically showcased all
  of hunt to ourselves. we also got t-shirts to wear on the day of hunt, but we
  were told to not show the back because it included spoilers. i, evan, and jake
  were told that we should split shifts to make sure that two of us were awake
  at all times where campus was open. i offered to be the one waking up early,
  but evan and jake were both more willing to do it than i was (they're both
  grad students), so i switched to the night shift. <br />i then went to go meet
  irl some people from one of my online puzzle friend groups (whom i hugged
  several times), and then the organizers of the how to hunt workshop, ben and
  jen, both of whom i recognized pretty easily. i went to the how to hunt
  workshop to socialize, and i talked to wayne and yannick for most of the time.
  at the conclusion of the how to hunt workshop, cryptics were mentioned as
  being bad and i yelled definitely too loudly that cryptic clues are better
  than regular clues since there are two ways to get the answer instead of just
  one, so you didn't need to know as much random trivia (or google as much) to
  do cryptics.
</p>

<p>
  we tested the phone number that night, and we noticed that the number that
  reaches the phone we were using is off by 1 from the number that we listed on
  the registration website. i spent a lot of time figuring out how to set up the
  phones so that the number we listed connected to a working phone. it was
  pretty annoying since we had like 10 phones with different numbers, and we
  needed to find the one that was linked to the number that we have displayed in
  public areas. i did eventually figure out how to do this, and also change it
  to redirect to a different person's phone. now i am hopefully able to show
  others how to do this.

  my experience in that week i would honestly describe as amazing, despite
  burnout. i suspect the main factor was me coming back on campus from back
  home, and now i had both time and motivation to work on my puzzles, and i
  could actually wear clothes that i actually liked. on top of that, i was also
  very excited to see the rest of teammate in person again, and some people for
  the first time. the only very slight drawbacks to being back on campus were
  that cj was next door again, so i couldn't talk loudly about puzzles, and
  decreased food security. the first one of that was solved primarily by me
  going to teammate's airbnb to do most of the puzzle work, and the second one
  was solved by me cooking very basic meals, as well as spending a lot of money
  to buy food.
</p>
<h1>hunt!</h1>

<p>
  then came friday, the day of hunt. early in the morning, i went to mit a/v to
  pick up the a/v equipment, then helped rahul tape signs on the doors to show
  what team was in which room. i wore my coat to hide the back of the shirt, and
  also my gloves so i wouldn't get papercuts on myself or sweat on the paper.
  this, of course, made me really hot, but i dealt with it since i'm pretty used
  to hot temperatures, though of course i made some non-serious complaints about
  it.
</p>
<p>
  i then went to flour to meet a bunch of other people from that friend group i
  mentioned earlier. they asked me to name as many people there as i could, and
  i managed to name almost everyone there except for two people (which makes 13
  out of 15), though the nametags that some people were wearing definitely
  helped, as did one of them prompting me to guess the people they were sitting
  next to.
</p>
<!--tluo, tckmn, rio futaba, hatter, tasthiluna, cheshire, syntax, davmillar, david glasser, sniper, deusovi, dylanamite, yyao were people i recognized, koala and wolfy were the people i didn't-->
<p>
  we then went outside and a passing teammate (i don't remember who) offered to
  take a picture of us, so this turned out to be my second face reveal in that
  server. i took quite a bit of pride in how i did my first one, in that it was
  one of my friends irl who posted the picture of me, making it much harder to
  find. one person i've told i've face revealed can attest to this, they told me
  they went several pages deep looking at pictures i've posted trying to find
  it.
</p>
<!--tckmn, tasthiluna-->
<p>
  i returned to kresge and watched the rehearsals of the opening skit. since
  this was my very first in-person hunt, i didn't know anything about what it
  should have been, so i thought the stuff that teammate said as teammate after
  the museum stuff ended was still part of the skit. i guess this year was the
  exception, where it was actually part of the skit, and some stuff unique to
  our hunt came up in this section.
</p>
<p>
  we set up our first hq in 2-105. the loading puzzle happened, and the first
  breakout was done by galactic in an hour. this was also around when we
  realized that hunt was gonna be way too long, so we made the decision to
  release hints early. later, some teams called us to see what was going on,
  since the puzzles seemed to not load, and we would respond with really funny
  comments implying that it was a puzzle. unfortunately, when we were
  responding, the entire room laughed pretty loudly which may have interfered
  with the person who answered the phone.
</p>
<p>
  we moved to the bush room as hq at 6pm, when it became available. at that
  time, i was at the art event, and there i met "that guy that i played spirit
  island with once", recognizing his discord handle from his nametag. he's one
  of the people i was really hoping to meet at hunt.
</p>
<!--duckmedic-->
<p>
  i went to all the events, since i was basically the person in charge (well,
  more specifically the point of contact) of the rooms that the events were held
  in. this took up most of saturday as well, and i stayed in the student center,
  where the events were held, since it was cold outside. i also really wanted to
  interact with people as much as i could, so i went on a lot of team visits,
  including the ones to florey, random, and wafflehaus, since i knew people on
  those teams personally (and actually had tap access to florey). i also went to
  several midpoint interactions, though not the very first one that galactic
  had.
</p>
<h1>big changes</h1>

<p>
  in efforts to make the hunt move more quickly, we decided to rearrange the
  unlocking order of bootes round, so the puzzle i've been working on all year
  was moved to near the end. i was fine with that, though it would mean that et
  would not get to it before hunt ended.
</p>
<p>
  then, on saturday evening, we made the big decision. two of them, actually.
  <br />the smaller change for us, but more notable change for hunters, was that
  we changed reactivation to only need 3 out of the 4 metas before it. this is
  more notable for hunters because it was the one that was actually visible.
  <br />the bigger change for us, but less noticeable change for hunters, was
  that we cut 2/3 of the bootes round, leaving just the space modules meta and
  its feeders still in hunt. this got somewhat mixed results, as some teammates
  were audibly upset, but most teammates applauded the exec team for making this
  big decision. surprisingly, i was mostly unaffected by this, even though the
  puzzle i've been working on all year was in one of the two cut rounds, because
  there was a very strong agreement within teammate that we should have the rest
  of the bootes round released afterwards in a mini-hunt, similar to star rats
  from 2022, except after hunt instead of before. it also guaranteed that et
  wouldn't see my puzzle before hunt ended.
</p>
<p>
  i must admit, i would have slightly preferred "split hunt into two hunts"
  (i.e. cut the 4 ai rounds entirely and save them all for a different hunt)
  over "let the rest of hunt be seen". i didn't really understand how much
  tech/logistics/other work would have to be done, and i still don't understand
  the tech stuff, though i would expect the logistics part to be the same, maybe
  slightly easier for the entirety of pc, but probably substantially more for me
  (since i'll have to do the stuff that walker did last year). this time though
  i feel like i'm somewhat equipped to do the logistics work, especially since
  walker already did a substantial amount of arguing for us so it'll hopefully
  be easier to talk to people about mh. (ily walker :heart:)
</p>
<p>
  the biggest benefit to splitting hunt into two parts would have been that more
  of hunt actually gets solved. on sunday, we ended up spilling a tank of free
  answers onto the sea of puzzlers, and this made it so that a lot of the
  puzzles that i was hoping to get solved instead got skipped. in particular, it
  seemed like a lot of teams skipped eye and bootes rounds completely, so they
  couldn't have discovered the gimmicks on their own.
</p>
<p>
  the one legit issue i had with splitting hunt into two parts is that sometimes
  puzzles have expiration dates. generally, puzzles about anything related to
  pop culture would be very at risk of being outdated by january 2024, though
  some of it would be not too big a deal to change, some may be too constrained
  to change and may need to be rewritten.
</p>
<p>
  i noticed that evan was holding that heart plushie that i remember seeing him
  with a long time ago. apparently he was burning out, but i unfortunately
  didn't realize it. if i did, i would have offered him hugs.
</p>
<p>
  on saturday night, teams finally started solving reactivation, which means
  that we needed to do the midpoint interaction with them. i didn't go on the
  very first interaction with galactic in the earlier evening, but near the
  closing time of 1am, a bunch of other teams solved reactivation, so like 20
  teammates went as a mob to do the midpoint interaction with each of them in
  order. i was the one who turned the lights off after every interaction we had,
  which i guess was thematic since that's what my name means.
</p>
<p>
  when we went into sunday, the hunt being long had a ton of other implications
  for logistics. the most important change was that the final runaround had to
  be changed. we had reserved some rooms (in particular, la sala and mezzanine)
  for sunday but not monday, and those we originally planned to use for the
  runaround. however, we did not see any team finishing before either of the
  rooms closed (which was 10pm), so a ton of changes had to be made. in
  particular, conjuri's part of the runaround was originally going to involve a
  fancy setup in la sala that actually had colored lights, and we also needed to
  rearrange hq because it's the only other place we could put the monitor bank
  and the conveyor belt that were originally in mezzanine. maybe we could have
  had the rooms and lights for another day if i called earlier, but this was not
  something that we were actively thinking about until the afternoon, and by
  that time the cac (office that rooms in the stud were reserved from) was
  closed, so we couldn't re-reserve the rooms. without a reservation, we
  couldn't keep the lights either, so we decided to just not bother with either
  of the rooms the day after and move everything.
</p>
<p>
  so the lesson i learned from this is to always plan for the worst case, not
  just some bad cases.
</p>
<p>
  later on sunday, et phone in answer solved reactivation. i was the one in
  charge of doing the midpoint interaction. since they were a hybrid team that
  was nearby but too far to walk to in person, i could do it in the discord
  server that they were solving in. after the interaction ended, instead of
  turning off the lights, i instead took advantage of my permission to manage
  channels and deleted the voice channel that we were in. at least the rest of
  puzzle club exec, and the people on teammate i told about this, approved of
  this action, though et was definitely surprised, and when someone from et
  mentioned this on discord, there were lots of :notlikeduck: reactions.
</p>
<!--linus-->
<p>
  on sunday night, we discussed what we were going to do with the removed bootes
  puzzles. we mostly agreed that we didn't want to do additional work on these
  puzzles, and to reconvene in march, after everybody cooled down, to talk about
  this. this was a long time, which was enough for me to make edits to my cut
  puzzle to make it easier, as well as possibly expand it even further. there
  was also some talk about renaming the round when it is released by adding new
  letters to the end, and this is where "further galaxies" was suggested. a
  couple of us also thought about changing "expedition" to "expansion", though
  that would probably need more work from art which may not have been feasible.
</p>
<p>
  on monday, i woke up around 10am and stayed in my room until just before
  wrap-up. i missed all the runarounds, but i was too tired to wait. i saw that
  a lot of teammates were wearing their team (other ai) shirts, and i became sad
  that i didn't have one, since i really wanted a team bootes shirt.
  fortunately, i was able to buy one after hunt.
</p>
<p>
  i spoke about puzzle club and acknowledgements at the end of wrap-up, and
  because i wanted applause, the first thing i said was "as some of you may have
  noticed, hunt is in-person".
</p>
<h1>after hunt</h1>

<p>
  after hunt ended on monday, i met up with others from puzzle club exec (except
  walker who had covid). they were surprised that they saw no puzzles that were
  about any of my strong interests of spirit island, minecraft, or square
  dancing, so i decided to tell them about the removed bootes puzzles. i figured
  that puzzle club exec was a small and trustworthy enough group that i could
  tell just them about this and still have the secret still be fairly confined.
  we met up with teammate later, and we were still talking about bootes round. i
  was hoping that we'd release the removed puzzles substantially earlier, but i
  did like having the release time be thematic. i suggested the bootes
  culmination at 4:13am, which was sometime around february 25th, but there was
  no way that was happening. the popular date suggested at the meeting on sunday
  night was may 2nd, which was the bootes culmination at midnight, though i
  don't remember whether that was with or without daylight savings. actually i
  guess i could calculate it, i'm pretty sure it's without. however, that also
  is failing to happen, and instead it'll be around the culmination at 11pm edt.
</p>
<p>
  i decided i wanted to keep the pillars of the museum, so i and a couple other
  teammates brought them to floorpi. i moved one to room 2-131 because i knew
  there was a squares thing happening that night so i wanted to use it to dance
  bigons, even though dancing bigons at anything above a2 was something i still
  wasn't experienced with, and this was a continuing c2 class which is two
  levels above a2. i later moved a pillar all the way to et, which was a pretty
  difficult endeavor, and one i regret not wearing a hat for, since it was
  really cold along the way.
</p>
<p>
  immediately after hunt, i for some reason felt like i wanted to write more
  puzzles. i'm not sure exactly what caused this to happen, it might have been
  some amount of validation starvation combined with being in the mindset to
  write puzzles. in fact, i told cj that i wanted to write for [unspecified
  puzzle event] this year, though i also said that i wouldn't want to join in
  the writing until the theme was chosen and the bootes reconvening happened.
</p>
<p>
  similarly, though on a slower timescale, after seeing all of those blog posts
  about hunt and some newly made blogs also appear to host these blog posts, i
  was inspired to write my own stuff about hunt, and potentially make a blog for
  it. however, i didn't know coding and wanted to learn how to make a website
  for other purposes (in particular, that web app that cj said we'd never
  build), so i procrastinated on this until spring break.
</p>
<p>
  the penultimate directly hunt thing to happen was the ama with teammate on
  january 22nd. there, we did actually have plans for what to say if anyone
  asked about the removed puzzles, or anything related to removing puzzles. we
  were going to admit that we removed puzzles, but not give any more details
  about them. however, since we didn't tell anyone besides puzzle club, nobody
  even asked about it, so we didn't even have to worry about that.
</p>
<p>
  finally, on february 2nd, teammate had a post-hunt debriefing. at the
  debriefing, there was some talk about writing a crossword and a cat round as
  intro rounds for the cut bootes puzzles, since they were shown on some
  screenshots of the monitor bank. i thought this was actually a reasonable idea
  story-wise and possibly puzzle-wise, though i didn't know how much other
  effort it would take. we were also definitely questioning how hard these intro
  rounds would be, since they would need to ramp up to the bootes round with the
  hardest puzzles. i was pretty enthusiastic about doing this, but my desire to
  get the puzzles released before summer was stronger.
</p>
<p>
  now that it's may, we're announcing the release of the rest of the bootes
  round, rebranding it from abcde to abcdefg. these puzzles could be considered
  a "teammate hunt" since it was written by teammate, but it's also not branded
  as a teammate hunt (also previous teammate hunts were letters changing by 0,
  abcdefg has letters changing by 1). i don't think teammate will release an
  actual on-brand teammate hunt in 2023, so i can't really stop you from calling
  abcdefg "teammate hunt 2023". a funny thing i noticed was that mystery hunt
  has a recommended team size ceiling, but abcdefg has a recommended team size
  floor.
</p>
<p>
  this post getting released was pushed back several times from its initial plan
  of may first. it was blocked on story for a while because deciding what to put
  as the story was hard. and i didn't want to release this too far before the
  actual hunt announcement. then we decided to delay the announcement by another
  couple of days because of unfortunate events in the first week of may, and
  then because of microsoft puzzle hunt. after waiting an entire week, it's
  finally getting released today. it's
  <a src="https://abcde.puzzlefactory.place/">finally out</a>!
</p>
<p>
  i will likely talk more about abcdefg in a future post, probably sometime
  around mid-june after they're released, so stay tuned!
</p>
