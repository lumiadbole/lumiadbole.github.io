<h3>parody of the devil went down to georgia</h3>

<p>
  the englishmen left the harbor, they were looking for some land to farm
  <br />
  they were in a bind 'cause they were way behind and they were going to do much
  harm
  <br />
  when they came across this island floating in the ocean with native huts
  <br />
  and the english docked upon a hickory tree and said "guys, let us tell you
  what"
</p>
<p>
  i guess you won't believe it, but we are gonna take this isle
  <br />
  and if you try to make a move we will be getting vile
  <br />
  now you have a pretty good culture, guys, but give us english our due
  <br />
  we'll bet a million pounds against your ground 'cause we think we're better
  than you"
</p>
<p>
  the natives said "we're dahan, and we might not survive,
  <br />
  but we'll take your bet; you're gonna regret because this island is alive"
</p>
<p>
  dahan, spirits, ready up and cast your powers hard.
  <br />
  the island is invaded and the english deal the cards
  <br />
  and if you win you get to make their home country disband
  <br />
  but if you lose, invaders get your land
</p>
<p>
  the english started bringing ships and they said "let's start to build"
  <br />
  and cities and towns were rising up as they started forming guilds
  <br />
  and they dug their axes in the stones and they made a large abyss
  <br />
  and a band of miners joined in and they sounded something like this
</p>
<p>
  when the english finished, spirits said, "well you're pretty good, strange
  men,
  <br />
  i'm gonna blow it up now, and then you can try again
</p>
<p>
  fire in the mountain. run boys run
  <br />
  that city's in the land of the scorching sun
  <br />
  creepers in the mortar breaking the walls
  <br />
  towns paralyzed by unnerving palls
</p>
<p>
  the english left the island 'cause they know that they'd been beat
  <br />
  and they left their city ruins on the island in defeat
  <br />
  dahan said, "englishmen, come on back, if you ever wanna press your luck
  <br />
  we have told you once, you're not gonna win, we are gonna get you stuck"
  <br />
  and they went:
</p>
<p>
  fire in the mountain. run boys run
  <br />
  the city's in the land of the scorching sun
  <br />
  creepers in the mortar breaking the walls
  <br />
  towns frightened by unnerving palls
</p>
