<p>
  so most things in spirit island happen only once and do the same thing every
  time it happens. for this reason, most growths in spirit island are either
  constant or linear. this includes health of invaders in a land (ignoring the
  ramping from invader stages), or amount of cards gained over time (unless
  cards gained let you gain more cards). however, some things don't do the same
  thing every time, and therefore can cause ramping. let's look at some examples
  of ramping.
</p>

<h1>part 1: quadratic growths</h1>
<h3>featuring: fractured, gays, lair</h3>
<p>
  so most of the non-linear growths come from doing things over and over, which
  is a thing that not all spirits have the ability to do.
</p>
<p>
  the first things that come to mind are spirits that can do things as many
  times as they want, but with increasing costs for each new thing done.
</p>
<p>
  this includes slip the flow of time, with an increasing time cost, and
  relentless punishment, with an increasing energy cost. they're both n(n-1)/2
  for n uses, which is order n^2.
</p>
<p>
  now for lair. if you look at the 4 moon innate on lair, it mentions a range
  equal to how much air lair has.
</p>
<p>
  let's assume that each land has about the same size and same diameter. there
  are a finite number of different lands, so this can be approximately true.
</p>
<p>
  so within range n of the lair would be roughly a circle of radius (n+0.5)
  lands. the area increases quadratically, and since the area of a land is
  roughly constant, the number of lands you can cover with that range increases
  quadratically.
</p>

<h1>part 2: n^1.5??</h1>
<h3>featuring: blight</h3>
<p>
  let's say we've been adding blight to a land repeatedly. if we do the minimum
  cascading possible, at some point we'll have cascaded into every land within
  range n.
</p>
<p>
  because the number of lands within range n is order n^2, and each blight added
  will cascade into a distinct land within range n, we'd need to add order n^2
  blight to the original land to have blighted every land within range n.
</p>
<p>
  because there are order n^2 lands within range n, there are order n lands at
  exactly range n. so to go from range n to range n+1, we have to add n times
  order n blight, which is order n^2 blight in total.
</p>
<p>
  the sum of the first n squares is order n^3. so you're adding order n^3 blight
  in total to add order n^2 blight in the original land, which is a growth rate
  of order n^1.5.
</p>

<h1>part 3: exponential growth</h1>
<h3>featuring: lair, a second time</h3>
<p>
  you've seen the air range on the 4 moon innate grows quadratically. however,
  more significantly, the 4 moon innate of the lair innate gathers 1 invader for
  every 6 explorers (and dahan) in the lair. so if there's a sufficient supply
  of invaders appearing near the lair, the cardinality of the lair can increase
  by 1/6 of its size every turn.
</p>
<p>
  this is exponential growth. this is also how we managed to get 79 explorers in
  one land in a 3-player game.

<p>i wonder if you can build an anti-6/6 strategy out of this.</p>

<h1>part 4: super-exponential growth</h1>
<h3>featuring: bodan</h3>
<h2>section 4.1: intro</h2>
<p>
  let's say bodan used melt earth in one land, and a town was pushed into that
  land.
</p>
<p>
  melt earth "destroys" the town for 2 extra fear, then kicks it somewhere (or
  doesn't, if the isolate is used).
</p>
<p>
  this essentially doubles the fear generation against towns and explorers in
  adjacent lands, which was used extensively with violence in one of my previous
  posts to generate large amounts of fear.
</p>

<h2>section 4.2: bouncing</h2>
<p>
  now let's say that bodan used melt earth in two adjacent lands. now let's push
  a town into one of the two lands.
</p>
<p>
  melt earth "destroys" the town for 2 extra fear, then kicks it into the other
  melt earth land, generating 2 more, for 4 in total. this triples the fear
  generated by towns and explorers in lands adjacent to either melted land.
</p>
<p>this isn't super impressive, but it will increase more quickly.</p>

<h2>section 4.3: bouncing harder</h2>
<p>
  now let's say that bodan used melt earth twice in land a, and once in an
  adjacent land b. let's label these uses a1, a2, and b. now let's push a town
  into land a.
</p>
<p>
  this push triggers both melt earth a1 and a2. let's resolve a1 first and kick
  into b, then use b kicks back into a where a2 can kick it again for 6 fear in
  total.
</p>
<p>
  however, this is only the end of the branch that started with a1. what about
  the branch that started with a2?
</p>
<p>
  well, if the town is still in land a when the initial a2 gets its turn to
  resolve, that resolution of a2 is its own branch. a2 kicks the town to b, then
  b kicks the town back to a, then a1 triggers again. because this is a separate
  branch, all 3 of these melt earths get to trigger again.
</p>
<p>this has gone from a 3x multiplier to a 7x multiplier on fear.</p>
<p>this diagram made by i think mj is a pretty good explanation:</p>
<img src="/assets/img/meltearth3.jpg" />
<p>there's also this diagram for 4 uses of melt earth:</p>
<img src="/assets/img/meltearth4.jpg" />

<h2>section 4.4: super-exponential growth</h2>
<p>
  so let's say we have n uses of melt earth split as evenly as possible between
  two lands. say you push a town into the land with more uses.
</p>
<p>
  it triggers ceil(n/2) melt earths, all starting their own branch. each
  individual branch would kick the town into the other land, which would all
  then start this scenario if there were n-1 uses of melt earth.
</p>
<p>
  so if you define melt earth melt earth of n (shortened as meme(n)) to be the
  fear multiplier of n uses of melt earth, divided as evenly as possible between
  two lands. <br />
  we have meme(n)=1+ceil(n/2)*meme(n-1).
</p>
<p>this is a factorial growth speed, which is faster than exponential.</p>

<h2>section 4.5: what else can do this?</h2>
<p>
  call to guard does approximately the same thing as melt earth, except that it
  doesn't automatically destroy things, but it works with badlands to destroy
  e.g. cowsburg towns.
</p>
<p>
  also, vengeance of the dead is a similar effect that triggers every time
  something is destroyed in target land. it's slightly less interesting because
  it destroys things completely and therefore doesn't generate much fear, but it
  also scales factorially similarly to melt earth.
</p>
<p>
  in fact, vengeance scales faster, because the number of initial triggers is n
  instead of ceil(n/2). however, since it's limited by amount of invader health,
  which doesn't grow super quickly, people haven't designed strategies around
  this.
