<p>
  since the release of nature incarnate, out of all 8*68=544 aspect-adversary
  pairs, surprisingly many are beatable at level 6 on turn 1. in fact, at least
  a quarter of them are. i've stopped at exactly a quarter to make this post.<br />
  (but please check my work, some of it might be wrong) <br />
  (also, if you find more, you can comment it on the sheet)

  violence wins using the combos shown in
  <a href="/si_theory/2023/07/26/si_t1_victories.html">this post</a>
</p>
<p>the updated tier list:</p>

<h3>other things to point out</h3>
<p>
  there are also a bunch more aspects (that aren't violence) that can defeat a
  6/6 on turn 1. i have found 8 so far, namely the ones in tier ss. i'll talk
  about them in a future post.
</p>
<p>
  over 3/4 of the combos i've found involve tsac. some of them may be doable
  without tsac, but it does make a lot of the combos much easier.
</p>
<p>
  more specifically, a lot of these combos are very similar to each other. any
  spirit who can play haunts and embers 3 times on turn 1, with at least 2 of
  those happening before the blight card flips, will beat prussia, france, and
  saltsburg 6 by hitting terror 2. a lot of spirits can do this by having 3
  energy, a card gain, and at least 3 presence on the island after t1 growth,
  and this lets them take twinned days and haunts and embers with tsac.
</p>
<p>
  relatedly, prussia, france, and saltsburg are almost always beaten at terror
  2. the only aspects that defeat any of these at other levels are locus against
  france specifically, which wins at terror 1, and violence, which wins at
  terror 4.
</p>
<p>
  only 4 of these combos were possible before nature incarnate, those are the
  ones highlighted in blue. the stuff added in nature incarnate that was very
  helpful included not just tsac, but also these:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    the blight card border between life and death. border is basically one more
    blight that can be on the island for free, which means that spirits can get
    4 fear in all 3 uses of haunts and embers and still survive aid from lesser
    spirits. the energy is also quite useful for spirits that don't use tsac but
    otherwise need energy to carry out the turn 1 victory, such as gays.
  </li>
  <li>
    the blight card shattered fragments of power. some spirits have ways to play
    extra cards during fast phase, so this card lets those spirits play an extra
    major instead of a minor or unique.
  </li>
  <li>
    the fear card daunted by the dahan. it's another fear card that generates
    fear without needing any towns on the island to exist, which is useful for
    getting another fear closer to terror 2, when dahan reclaim fishing grounds
    and angry mobs have already been used.
  </li>
  <li>
    spirits starting with more presence than before, sometimes because they have
    an incarna. this lets them tsac the full 3 presence and sometimes have a
    sacred site remaining to target powers like scour. for example, tree and
    waters both start with 4 presence on the island. locus also is much stronger
    here, since aegis is useless here anyways, and having 3 presence means that
    one can even be absorbed.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  a bunch of combos are one explorer away from winning, i will probably add a
  separate counter for when there is one explorer remaining. this is most often
  the case when a spirit doesn't generate enough fear cards to remove the last
  explorer. <br />
  the most notable instance of this is sparking against scotland 6.
