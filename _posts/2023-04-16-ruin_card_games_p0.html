title: "how to ruin card games, part 0: my personal background"
---

<p>
  i taught a class on this so i might as well type up some notes and save them
  for later
</p>

<p>
  o there are a lot of card games. some of which some people like more than
  others.
</p>
<p>
  this includes me. there are card games that i like and card games that i don't
  like.
</p>
<p>
  however, i honestly don't play card games a ton anymore, i prefer to spend my
  time playing spirit island. so a bit of background on myself:
</p>
<p>
  i've been playing card games for a long time now. i don't even remember how i
  started, but pretty early on, i learned about several card games from
  clubhouse games on the nintendo ds, such as rummy, crazy eights, and bridge.
</p>
<p>
  my next exposure to card games, around middle school, was extended family. we
  played a lot of games where twos are higher than aces, which included games
  like tractor, zheng shang you (a game pretty similar to president) and dou di
  zhu (screw with the landlord).
</p>
<p>
  finally, in high school, i would actually start having friends, a large swath
  of which was through math competitions. and some of them liked card games.
  this was where i played a lot of canadian fish/literature, coup, and also how
  i learned several really good board games, like seven wonders and stone age.
  in senior year, i was introduced to riichi mahjong, which was an obsession
  that lasted for a year.
</p>
<p>
  finally, i was introduced to spirit island in freshman spring of college, and
  from there it took over my life, so i didn't really feel a need to learn more
  card games. i did still learn at least one card game, a coop trick-taking game
  called the crew.
</p>
<p>
  now, i still have pretty strong preferences about card games, even though i
  haven't played many of them in a while. i guess this period of not playing
  should make all my opinions of these card games better than back when i was
  more involved in them and i was actually competitive most of the time.
</p>
let's start with the ones i remember really liking:
<ul>
  <li>gin rummy</li>
  <li>seven bridge</li>
  <li>continental bridge</li>
  <li>tractor</li>
  <li>finding friends</li>
</ul>
there are some games i have generally positive opinions towards but not as
strongly as the ones above:
<ul>
  <li>hearts</li>
  <li>spades</li>
  <li>wizard and jester</li>
  <li>president</li>
  <li>kent</li>
  <li>99</li>
  <li>crazy eights</li>
  <li>coup</li>
  <li>uno</li>
  <li>uno oops all wilds</li>
</ul>
as you can tell, i generally like trick-taking games. <br />

there are games i'm generally neutral about:
<ul>
  <li>bs</li>
  <li>canadian fish</li>
  <li>speed</li>
  <li>hanabi</li>
  <li>dominion</li>
</ul>

finally, there are games i'm generally negative about:
<ul>
  <li>mao</li>
  <li>ers</li>
  <li>poker</li>
  <li>texas hold'em</li>
</ul>

and there are also games that i've just never played before.
<ul>
  <li>cribbage</li>
  <li>nerts</li>
  <li>
    euchre (i might have played this one actually but i don't remember it at
    all)
  </li>
  <li>tichu</li>
</ul>
out of all of these, ers and mao are the two i actively dislike. mao, if played
badly, is basically hazing, while ers is too physical, and it involves card
counting. these two are the ones i have the best designed ruining strategies and
will be focusing on in the future parts.
