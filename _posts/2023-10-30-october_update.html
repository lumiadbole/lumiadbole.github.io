<p>don't worry, i'm still alive, i just have classes</p>
<p>fortunately, i can make 3 out of my 4 classes about spirit island</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    conlangs. i'm using the class to theorize about what the dahan language
    would be like
  </li>
  <li>
    writing short stories. no prizes for guessing what i'm writing in my stories
  </li>
  <li>
    hardness proofs. where i figure out if spirit island is np-hard. (spoilers:
    it is, so i'm instead looking at pspace-hardness)
  </li>
  <li>
    history of cs education, which i haven't yet been able to insert spirit
    island into
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  as for posting here, i'm currently looking harder at t1 victories, and seeing
  how many distinct spirit-adversary pairs can be beaten at level 6 on turn 1.
  there are surprisingly many, a lot of which are because of tsac.
