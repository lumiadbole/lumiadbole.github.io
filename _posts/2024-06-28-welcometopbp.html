<h2>here, have a third parody of welcome to the intenet</h2>

<p>
  welcome to the play by posts <br />
  have a look around <br />
  anything that is remotely balanced can be found <br />
  we've got dozens of channels <br />
  some normal, some cursed <br />
  if none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first
</p>

<p>
  welcome to the play by posts <br />
  feel free to just observe <br />
  would you like to have an island that is negatively curved <br />
  there's no need to panic <br />
  the others won't bite, haha <br />
  just add reactions to the posts that you like
</p>

<p>
  welcome to the play by posts <br />
  what would you prefer? <br />
  would you like to fight the french with trickster, ocean, eyes, or earth?
  <br />
  all downpour <br />
  all starlight <br />
  all lightning immense <br />
  68-spirit games are kinda intense
</p>

<p>
  welcome to the play by posts <br />
  feel free to play your main <br />
  here's a game for learning finder <br />
  here's a seventh wave campaign <br />
  we've got prussia, plus sweden, plus varied terrains <br />
  and a bunch of lower leveled games where you can't see the invaders and need
  to remember where they are
</p>

<p>
  welcome to the play by posts <br />
  play your cards with air <br />
  the entirety of russia's getting sucked into the lair <br />
  they have help from the miners <br />
  and they're still coming here <br />
  make them afraid, the pull gets stronger with fear
</p>

<p>
  play vanilla scotland <br />
  or one where you can't reclaim <br />
  try a ritual of terror <br />
  or of the destroying flame
</p>

<p>
  play a blitz game against prussia <br />
  send invaders when you crush 'em <br />
  or defend the heart from russia <br />
  there's no pressure we don't always win these
</p>

<p>
  here's a normal russia 4 game <br />
  add a bunch of beasts <br />
  here's a sweden 6 thematic <br />
  here's 4 spirits all on east
</p>

<p>
  which major power are you <br />
  specializing in? <br />
  this island has invaders here so give that card a spin
</p>

<p>
  we can give the island anything <br />
  all of the time <br />
  a little bit of everything <br />
  all of the time <br />
  apathy's a tragedy <br />
  not knowing is a crime <br />
  anything and everything <br />
  all of the time
</p>

  you know, it wasn't always like this <br />
  not very long ago <br />
  before we found you <br />
  right before horizons came, 2022
</p>

<p>
  we had board game geek <br />
  every week <br />
  had one turn or two <br />
  we set our sights and spent our nights <br />
  playing them through <br />
  and we found something too
</p>

<p>
  we just made a second server <br />
  it was very new <br />
  but we added the things <br />
  that we wanted to do
</p>

<p>
  now look at you, oh <br />
  look at you, you, you <br />
  unstoppable, watchable <br />
  our time is now <br />
  our inside's out <br />
  look at how we grew
</p>

<p>
  and if we play together <br />
  who knows what we'll do <br />
  it was always the plan <br />
  to put the game in our hands <br />
  *evil laughter*
