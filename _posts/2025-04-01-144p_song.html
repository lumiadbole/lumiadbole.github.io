<p>(yes, the timing is on purpose)</p>

<p>
  there's this island we love
  <br />
  invaders taking with no remorse
  <br />
  an insurrection's what we're thinking of
  <br />
  they are responding, with military force
</p>
<p>
  we just wanna stand up for this island
  <br />
  gotta make them understand
</p>
<p>
  we are gonna suck them up
  <br />
  we are gonna burn them down
  <br />
  we are gonna march around, and fight them
</p>
<p>
  we are gonna break their plows
  <br />
  we are gonna drown their cows
  <br />
  we are gonna drought the land, and blight them
</p>
<p>
  we have been fighting for so long
  <br />
  they're escalating, but we're prepared to take it
  <br />
  we see they don't know what's been going on
  <br />
  we know the game, and we're gonna break it
</p>
<p>
  and, if you look at how they're feeling
  <br />
  we can tell they're too scared to see
</p>
<p>
  we are gonna suck them up
  <br />
  we are gonna burn them down
  <br />
  we are gonna march around, and fight them
</p>
<p>
  we are gonna break their plows
  <br />
  we are gonna drown their cows
  <br />
  we are gonna drought the land, and blight them
</p>
<p>
  we are gonna suck them up
  <br />
  we are gonna burn them down
  <br />
  we are gonna march around, and fight them
</p>
<p>
  we are gonna break their plows
  <br />
