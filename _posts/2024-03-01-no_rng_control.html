<h2>intro</h2>

<p>so my gf sent me a meme:</p>

<!--insert image here-->
<img src="/assets/img/stopcontrollingrng.png" />

<p>i was like "fine"</p>

<p>
  here are some optimizations that don't involve controlling what cards you draw
</p>

<h2>section 1: presence</h2>

<p>
  snek has a presence cap. how many presence can we take off its tracks on turn
  1?
</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">
  max number of presence that snek can add
</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>spirits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>green</li>
    <li>fractured</li>
    <li>might</li>
    <li>downpour</li>
    <li>mentor</li>
    <li>snek</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    additionally, snek needs to be on a board whose land 5 is within range 7 of
    a land with blight and invaders. this is probably not hard to do, but the
    land in question depends on the initial explore. fractured also needs to
    have a setup presence within range 5 of that land. let's call that land the
    "blurring land"
  </p>
  <p>spirit phases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      green adds presence from top track, gains a power card and 3 energy, and
      plays prolif (3 energy left)
    </li>
    <li>
      fractured takes the sun growth option, gains 3 time from bottom track,
      moves presence adjacent to the blurry land, and plays past returns + blur
    </li>
    <li>
      might adds presence from top track, gains 2 energy, and plays rituals
    </li>
    <li>downpour does anything it wants and plays abundance</li>
    <li>
      mentor adds a presence from bottom track and plays teachings + share
      secrets
    </li>
    <li>
      snek adds a presence to a land within range 5 of the blurring land, and
      plays absorb
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>fast:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>mentor gives fractured study to play, and prepares plant</li>
    <li>
      mentor prepares plant and gifts snek earth plant plant with teachings
    </li>
    <li>green prolifs snek <b>(2)</b></li>
    <li>snek absorbs green</li>
    <li>fractured slips prolif</li>
    <li>green prolifs snek <b>(3)</b></li>
    <li>fractured slips prolif</li>
    <li>green prolifs snek <b>(4)</b></li>
    <li>fractured slips prolif</li>
    <li>green prolifs snek <b>(5)</b></li>
    <li>might plays draw, then gives green gift of strength</li>
    <li>downpour gives green abundance</li>
    <li>green prolifs snek <b>(6)</b></li>
    <li>
      fractured blurs the blurring land, cascading blight to destroy 2 of snek's
      presence
    </li>
    <li>green prolifs snek <b>(7)</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>in slow, snek prolifs itself with its left innate <b>(8)</b></p>
  <p>notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      this is enough for snek to have 4 card plays or 6 energy income on turn 2.
    </li>
    <li>
      this also works for locus since it starts with a free presence off tracks
      instead of the prolif from left innate.
    </li>
    <li>
      if blur can cascade 1 more blight, snek can add another presence next turn
      and be on 5 card plays.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  regrowth green has a lot of destroyed presence. how much presence can it have
  on the board (from tracks or destroyed pool) on turn 1?
</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">
  max number of regrowth presence on the island
</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    strategy: abundance is very good at restoring regrowth's destroyed presence,
    and it also gives repeats and energy, so we play this as much as possible

  <ul>
    <li>regrowth</li>

    <li>might</li>

    <li>

    <li>downpour adds 2 presence from top track and plays abundance</li>
    <li>
      mentor adds a presence from bottom track and plays teachings + share
      secrets
    </li>
    <li>tree does anything and plays resilient power</li>
  </ul>
  <p>fast:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>mentor gives fractured study to play, and prepares air water</li>
    <li>mentor prepares plant and gives regrowth water plant with teachings</li>
    <li>
      downpour gains 2 energy with its 4 water + 1 more with its right innate
    </li>
    <li>might plays draw, then gives downpour gift of strength</li>
    <li>
      downpour gives regrowth abundance, regrowth adds a destroyed presence
      <b>(4)</b>
    </li>
    <li>
      downpour repeats abundance, giving regrowth 2 energy and adding a
      destroyed presence (regrowth has 4 energy) <b>(5)</b>
    </li>
    <li>fractured slips downpour to replay abundance</li>
    <li>
      downpour gives regrowth abundance, regrowth adds a destroyed presence

    in slow, tree gives regrowth resilient power and regrowth uses its right
    innate <b>(14)</b>

</div>

<p>incarna are usually presence. how many incarna can we empower on turn 1?</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">
  max number of incarna empowers
</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>how to empower each incarna, from easiest to hardest:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>eeb: just take the growth</li>
    <li>
      tree: take growth 2, play blooming, repeat blooming. alternatively, move
      incarna into a land with vitality, add another vitality, and somehow have
      or make a sacred site to add a third vitality in the slow. this can be
      done by a second card play to play resilient power, or a presence
      movement, or a prolif.
    </li>
    <li>
      voice: take growth 3, play turmoil's touch + frightful keening, either
      receive elemental support for moon+air or receive 1 card play to play
      exhale
    </li>
    <li>boddys: add 4 presence from top track</li>
    <li>locus: add 6 presence</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    it's pretty easy to get 3 empowers with fractured+green+mentor, but it isn't
    possible to get 4. here's the proof:
  </p>
  <p>
    we need 2 non-incarna spirits that can give out 3 prolifs, a card play, and
    a repeat. the only spirit that can give out multiple prolifs is green, and
    the only spirit that can increase that to 3 prolifs is fractured.
  </p>
  <p>
    the only incarna spirit that can give out any of these 3 is locus, which
    needs 5 prolifs, too many for fractured and green to give out. (fractured
    can gain at most 3 time, which is at most 3 repeats of prolif)
  </p>
  <p>
    otherwise, fractured needs to give 2 slips to green, 1 to voice, and 1 to
    tree, and fractured does not have enough time for all of this.

<h2>section 2: power cards</h2>

<p>
  how many cards can you remove from the power card decks on turn 1? (i say
  "remove from each deck" because i'm including putting into days that never
  were)
</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">minor powers</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    strategy: play boon of reimagining as many times as possible. playing it on
    fractured removes 3 minors from the deck, 4 if fractured still has unique
    powers remaining in hand or discard.
