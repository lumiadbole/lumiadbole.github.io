  hey handsome 😉 😳 are you ready to experience 💦 <b>nature incarnate</b> 💦
  together? my 🔥 <b>ember-eyed 👁️ behemoth</b> 🍆 can go on a ⛏️
  <b>mining expedition</b> 🗺️ through the <b>roots of the jungle</b> 🌴 and
  <b>down your spine</b> 🩻. afterwards, you can <b>relentlessly gaze</b> 👀 at
  my <b>unconstrained ⛓️ warrior</b> 🪖, and then tap my <b>salt deposits</b> 🧂
  so hard that i'll be 🤕 <b>wounded & bleeding</b> 🩸. you can go on as
  <b>terrifying</b> 😱 of a <b>rampage</b> as you want and 👯‍♂️
  <b>dance up earthquakes</b> 🌎 on my <b>locus</b>. after you
  <b>finally harvest</b> 🪴 me, my <b>transformative sacrifice</b> 🔪 will leave
  both 2️⃣ of our <b>shattered 💔 fragments of power</b> together 👬 at
  <b>the border of life and death</b> 💀. so, what do you say 💬? wanna have an
  👻 <b>ethereal conjunction</b> with me? 😘

  <p>
    tbh this looks better as a discord message (if on computer, you can right
    click and open in a new tab)
